## How our first meeting went

We had three presentations:

-   Works put together by Ramin for accessing the UDK university. A
    P5control example for defining inputs that modify the behaviour of a
    sketch on real time. Demo of using a MIDI controller for the same
    purpose, and a custom built XML file that serves as a bridge between
    Processing and the controller.
-   Using the Move controller and the Russian Roulette example.
-   Examples by Abe (linked below).\

## Ideas for next meeting

-   Decide a constraint and everybody then is given some time to create
    something using those constraints. When done, we place all the
    programs somewhere (online, on a USB stick) and we run them on one
    computer where each can explain (if she/he wants) what it does. Some
    ideas:
    -   Draw using circles only, larger than 3 px diameter.
    -   Use black and white only.
    -   Only do modifications to the pixels array, no other drawing
        allowed.
    -   Do a 10 second animation.
    -   ...
-   Present a technique (mini tutorial) starting from scratch in 10
    minutes. The idea of starting from scratch is to help people better
    understand what's going on. It's harder to get into a program that
    already exists than to see it evolve since its infancy :)
    -   Recursive programs.
    -   Editing the pixels array to achieve Photoshop-like effects.
    -   ...
-   Build a program collaboratively. We would set some rules that would
    allow, at the end of the session, to combine the programs written by
    all participants into a single program. Ideally, each of our
    programs would be affected by the behaviour of the previous program.
    In that way we would not be sure of what will happen until the thing
    is put together, hopefully getting beautiful and surprising results.
    We would agree on a screen resolution and a frame rate, and then how
    we would interface with each other. We should define a way in which
    our program provides a few variables to the next program (so we can
    use those values as kind of a random() number generator). The goal
    is that what others do affect our graphics. It's a bit hard to
    describe, but I (aBe) can prepare a demo.
-   Build programs that communicate with each other using Open Sound
    Control. There could be one computer running Processing connected to
    the proyector and listening to OSC messages. All participants would
    write Processing programs that send OSC messages to the main
    computer, which then draws on the screen usind the instructions
    received through OSC.
-   Hack your Controller: Tutorial on how to use libraries for
    Controller use MidiController, PSMove, Gamepads,  
-   A cool PSMove Game: We have several of them. 7 I think. We could
    brainstorm and create a cool multiplayer game\

## Web page for our group

Abe Pazos: We shortly discussed creating a web page for the group where people
would have profiles, and where we can upload photos, videos and discuss
any topics. One easy approach would be to use something that already
exists (a Google+ community, a Posterous Space). The other solution is
to build a Wordpress blog. Someone (sorry I don't remember the name)
volunteered to do that.

Lorenzo Pilia: Only a suggestion: if these events are going to stay under the
OpenTechSchool umbrella I'd suggest to check with the OTS team if they
have any recommendations regarding tools they might already have in
place that could be used to share projects, have discussions etc. For
example they already have several Google Groups in place. The main
advantage is that it would give more visibility to the group (OTS is
already reaching a lot of people through their network), making it
easier for new people to discover these Processing meetups in the
future. On top of that, all the shared info could be of use for OTS
groups in other cities if they want to start organizing their own
Processing events.\

Abe: It's a very good point, and now I feel a bit bad about suggesting the
use of this Titanpad, because maybe they already had those tools in
place, or places where to comment. I think these pads are great for
almost real time interaction, specially when done live while the meeting
takes place. Who should we talk to?

Lorenzo: No no! Don't feel bad at all! How were you supposed to know about this?
This Titan thing is so straight forward anyway, it can still be very
useful, I wasn't familiar with it so thanks! Rachel is the person who
was there yesterday who's currently more involved with OTS. Anyway
anyone's who's interested in organizing things or in genral be part of
OTS is more than invited to take part to their bi-weekly breakfast
meetings – they're really really nice people so don't be afraid. Check
<http://www.opentechschool.org/contact.html> for all the details!\

Abe: Ok! :)

Ramin Soleymani: Yes an discussion board to discuss and fix future plans would be good.
Lets see what we can get from OTS and what maybe we can make by our
own.
