# **Friday, January 2nd 2015, Stammtisch #15** 

**What was talked about?**
We had no computer for this first Stammtisch of 2015, but much was talked about, so here's our train of consciousness:

- [31C3 (Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page)
- Sensory Expansion / Body augmentation (Ramin implanted a neodymium magnet in his finger)
- Is the Creative Code Stammtisch name too specific? (verdict at the table: no)
- Ramin's Arduino DVD is at Dussmann! ([also Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/Das-Arduino-Training-Sehen-wies-Linux/dp/3836234564))
- Rachel is moving to Prenzlauerberg
- David O'Reilly's game, [Mountain](http://mountain-game.com/), and his [Thoughts on Mountain](https://medium.com/@davidoreilly/some-thoughts-on-mountain-a2a4b79dac53)
- [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror_%28TV_series%29) TV series, about the impending dangers of technology
- [Her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_%28film%29) film, about the friendlier side of technology

- aBe is learning [Overtone](https://overtone.github.io/) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
- People need to understand [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) to maintain digital privacy--here are some good resources:
  - Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/)
  - The Pirate Party's [Guide to Secure Emails](http://pirateparty.be/take-back-your-privacy-secure-emails)
- And some fiction that is also educational on the subject:
  - [Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/) and [Homeland](http://craphound.com/homeland/download/) by Cory Doctorow (free downloads directly from the author!) - a very approachable guide to security and hacker culture, aimed at young adults
