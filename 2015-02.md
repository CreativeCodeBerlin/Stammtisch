For those interested in building a Piccolo CNC ([http://piccolo.cc](http://piccolo.cc/)) send a (blank) email at piccolo@jelle.io (special inbox) and I'll put you on the mailing list (no obligations!). I'll then check for bulk prices upcoming week to see if we can get the price down towards 50 euro (Should be 100 euro max.)
