Discussion about art and science.

“The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver. It is truly one of the things that make life worth living and it does so, if anything, more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living is quite finite.” — Richard Dawkins

"Anything goes." — Paul Feyerabend

**--- IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ---**
After some discussion, we have decided 
it would be safer to move the Stammtisch 
away from the war zone that is traditionally 
Kottbusser Tor [on May 1st](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day_in_Kreuzberg). We will meet at 
the IXDS offices (thanks to Ramin). 

The address is:
**IXDS**
**Paul-Lincke-Ufer 39/40**
**4rd Backyard**

See you there!
