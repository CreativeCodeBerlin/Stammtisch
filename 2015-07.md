They often have to explain what they do and what their value is. There is often a misunderstanding between UX Designers and Developers. Soon to come on Medium. <PUT LINK HERE>

Audiovisual program. A swarm (boids) that represents a set of samples moves through plane- Their location determine their position in the sound plane.  The user can steer the swarm through the plane.  The audio-result is computed as if the user is  in the center of the plane.
For the sound demos: The spatial effect works best with headphones.

If you've ever been confused by math notation when reading academic papers, you will love this:

Raphaël*we never gonna give up latex! why having it easy, when u can have the pain of setting things up for a day for one symbol :)
Ramin* You can keep using Latex all you want. It's still nice to be able to translate this gibberish to something usable :P
*I'm still waiting for hardcore Latex/math equation art. maybe with this lib
* Ha ha ha. I don't think that's the point of the repo though. It's just a cheat sheet, not a conversion lib.
*Is it standard to add new content to the bottom of  stuff to see/read list? 
* We never agreed on a standard. I think everyone is doing what they want... ANARCHY!
*NICCCEEE. Lets remove this to the point of... well no. ANARCHY. cya friday
*Yo!
JR*Going the other way, there is a nice little library in MIT's scmutils that converts physics equations writtin in scheme into LaTeX for typesetting.
