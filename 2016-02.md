# **February 5th, Stammtisch #28 - Kiel remix**

Abe*Next is the original content, which was lost (Hackpad error?), Raphaël took screenshots of his cache, and I OCR'd and reconstructed.

Rachel*(What are the questions below in reference to? There's no context! thanks in advance!)
Abe* I added a bit of context

**We asked the participants to ask a question to the group:**

- What is your working space? Studio.
- What are you up to?
- What is creative coding for you? When is a project finished for you?
- What do you plan to do with these questions?
- What's the best thing so far in TM?
- What's going on in Kiel?
- Hate < ———————> Love (Where is Math, for you, on the spektrum?)
- What are the limits of using vvvv?

Abe* **We got these questions, but we didn't really answer them** :)

For the 100th anniversary of the Dada movement, a collector in Italy have commissioned scans of artworks.
Here an online project [http://dadaclub.online/](http://dadaclub.online/) where is possible to find some images high-res and some 3d model ready to remix.  Raphael shows a work from [http://jeremybailey.net/](http://jeremybailey.net/), where he has replaced web advertising with art.
