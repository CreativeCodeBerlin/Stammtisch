Database - a public installation on the subject of surveillance - [http](http://www.tobiaszimmer.net/projects/database.php)[://www.tobiaszimmer.net/projects/database.php](http://www.tobiaszimmer.net/projects/database.php), Composite Portraits [http://www.tobiaszimmer.net/projects/db_average_faces.php](http://www.tobiaszimmer.net/projects/db_average_faces.php) and pictures of ghosts: faces seen when there were no people in front of the camera. The installation will be shown in Paris this year.

1. Showing software for kids with disabilities. For instance, singing for blind children. He tested about 10 different libraries for pitch extraction. LibPyin was the only one good enough. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/xstreck1/LibPyin) for anyone to use.
2. Web-based multi-player Pop Science Quiz game. Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/xstreck1/PopSciQuiz).

[**Nuño de la Serna**](http://action-io.tumblr.com/)
WebGL experiment. Web server application. Mobile devices connect to it and send tilt information on real time. The tilt information is used to generate a 3D shape. 3 people control vertices, 1 person control the camera. Nuño wrote the whole engine from scratch on opengl, not using any libraries like three.js. This includes calculating the vertex positions, camera, normals, etc.

[**Anastasis Germanidis**](http://agermanidis.com/)
Randomly Generated Social Interactions - [https://vimeo.com/156882347](https://vimeo.com/156882347)
He did experiments in which algorithms and data controlled his life. In his latest project, he controlled others. A server creates identities for people, which receive instructions on their smartphones about how to interact with others: what to say and do.

He's starting a meetup on Creative AI (intersection between artist and artificial intelligence, deep learning, etc).

Makes surprising things with mundane objects. Chocolate female bodies that produce orgasmic sounds when eaten. Dress with flowers and conductive fabric that scream when touched. And more on her website.

Using [Tooll.io](http://tooll.io/) (Windows only) to synchronize sound to graphics. It's a node based application similar to VVVV. Real time graphical feedback loop (reaction diffusion). Trailer for the [Evoke](https://www.evoke.eu/2015/) demo party. In less than one month it will be open source and found on GitHub.

Showing the result of the last Creative Code Jam (SineDancers) - [http://hamoid.tumblr.com/page/2](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/page/2) and talking about the Copycat game we often play. The next Jam is on March 19th at co.up.

[**Karsten Jørgensen**](https://twitter.com/kahrzdn)
Participated in the last Creative Code Jam and did a web tool to imitate moves and dances by others.
