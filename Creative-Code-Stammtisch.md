# Creative Cod**e** **Stammtisch**
The Creative Code Stammtisch is a monthly open conversation between artists, makers, designers, coders, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression. There is usually a time for people to present something if they want to, followed by informal discussions. The event is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender or experience. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome.

# **October 6th, Stammtisch #44**

**Marie**
Beginning a game that uses blockchain technologies and explores the idea of trust. 

Sharing some of the questions she is asking in the early stages, as well as her log of technical work so far.

Some examples:


- What is trust? 
- What is the relationship of vulnerability and trust? 
- What does trust have to do with private property? 
- What about trust and our ownership of our own bodies?
- Where does decentralization *put* power? Can power be “put” somewhere?
- What is the difference between individual trust transactions and communal trust networks?
- Why does most game theory (seem to) gloss over the most interesting parts of trust (what is it, how does it work holistically, how do we grow it) in favour of the least interesting part (who “wins”)?
- Is consensus “neutral”? Is anything neutral?
- Can a system be neutral? Is neutrality just an extension of existing power?
- Is anything peer-to-peer when the peers don’t technically own or control the terms of service/platform?
- What will blockchain technologies do to labour? To the valuing of labour? Are we really moving into the attention economy?

Also showed “The evolution of trust” a game she found online.

**Peter Kolski**
Artificial Insulter (AI) - https://vimeo.com/206291184

**Davide**
On going project in which he uses lathe (revolution geometry). There’s videos about machines cutting rotating objects. There’s also a three.js class for creating lathe geometries. While working on those lathes in 3D, he found a free feather database online: https://www.featherbase.info/en/home . Next he combined both lathe + feathers.
He used gimp and a tool called crazybump for creating textures of feathers.

Created an algorithm that creates an interesting tube.
[3 rule program](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/post/145852002189/unstable-rules-maintain-a-predefined-distance) to create the cross section:

- from each point maintain the distance to next
- from each point maintain the distance to the rest
- avoid sharp edges

the progress of the shape over time represent one step across the tube… LINKS!

Neural network generating images that match a “kind” of image (tea pots, running shoes, faces…).
The software creates new images that look like something recognizable, and it’s not a “mix” of previous images, but something new. It does this by looking at the probability distribution of many images of the target kind, and then tries to imitiate that distribution.

- [ofxLSystemGrammar](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystemGrammar) is a implementation for [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). It creates a string that represents an L system.
- [ofxLSystem](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystem) reads the strings created by the previous addon and draws them (the results are called trees) . It can also draw in 3D and draw multiple trees.

Idea started at a Creative Code Jam. A way of showing photos at a gallery which is more engaging than with the usual still photos. The distance between you and the picture makes it sharper or more unfocused, so you need to move to experience the photo. Sound accompanies the photo, which also changes depending on the distance of the viewer. It uses 3 Raspberry Pi computers and a Kinect to control each image.

Ramin* You can keep using Latex all you want. It's still nice to be able to translate this gibberish to something usable :P
*I'm still waiting for hardcore Latex/math equation art. maybe with this lib
* Ha ha ha. I don't think that's the point of the repo though. It's just a cheat sheet, not a conversion lib.
*Is it standard to add new content to the bottom of  stuff to see/read list? 
* We never agreed on a standard. I think everyone is doing what they want... ANARCHY!
*NICCCEEE. Lets remove this to the point of... well no. ANARCHY. cya friday
*Yo!

Discussion about art and science.

“The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver. It is truly one of the things that make life worth living and it does so, if anything, more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living is quite finite.” — Richard Dawkins

"Anything goes." — Paul Feyerabend

*"How long do rainworks last?
*Each rainwork lasts about 4 months to a year, depending on the amount of foot traffic it has to endure. More abrasion means it will fade faster. A rainwork is the most vivid during its first couple of weeks, then slowly becomes more subtle."
*Apparently this is the product he uses: [http://nanexcompany.eu/always-dry.html](http://nanexcompany.eu/always-dry.html)
*Pretty cool!
*Wanna make some? :)
*He, why not? :) I'm wondering what other artistic uses of this coating we could think of... Like hydrophobic fountains? Or sculptures?
*I heard Hamburg had [some ideas](http://www.gizmag.com/st-pauli-pee-back-super-hydrophobic-walls/36424/).
*Definitely down for this
*I'd like to see the studies that prove it doesn't degrade in a way that's harmful for the environment.
*Nanocoating- that is for sure not environmentelfriendly or biodegradeable

- Check also [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/), a library for mobile and desktop videpgame development in JS. It is built on top of Pixi. It adds many functions like collision detection, gamepad input, tile mapping, sound... etc. Check the examples [here](http://examples.phaser.io/).

[**Abe Pazos**](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/)
Abe explains how to create a library for Processing in only 5 minutes. Export a jar from eclipse (preferably with a constructor passing the PApplet as parent). Create a folder in your P5 libraries folder with the library name. in there the jar goes into the library folder (that's the structure of all p5 libraries). the cool thing: you only have to restart processing when you created the library- so you can constantly change it, without closing your sketch. 
[https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Library-Overview](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Library-Overview)
Note: I was surprised by how easy it is. The P5 documents are longs, and it makes it feel like complicated. You're supposed to include examples, src, reference... but it is all optional! (if the library is just for yourself ;) The only thing you need is libraries/MyLib/library/MyLib.jar In that jar, you either have static methods, or you pass the PApplet so you can access all Processing drawing functions. By having your own library you can share code among all your sketches, no need to copy paste functions/classes or use other tricks.

Performance tip. Reusing Objects instead of creating new ones all over the place is important for a fast running program. To guarantee this abe showed us his program, where he initialized final Vectors, that are used for 3D Animation calculation using toxiclibs. Instead of creating new Vectors anywhere else, he called the methods that don't return new vectors but operate on themselves. - he pointed out: sometimes they have a self in their name sometimes get....
