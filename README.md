# Creative Code Stammtisch

The Creative Code Stammtisch is a monthly open conversation between artists, makers, designers, coders, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression.

We use Etherpad to document our meetups collaboratively in real time. To avoid the document growing too heavy, we regularly move the notes taken during a meetup from that shared document to this repository in GitHub.

How to update this page:

1. Go to [etherpad](https://funprogramming.org/pad/p/ccs) and export the document to markdown.
2. Open the downloaded file, cut the content that matches one month, and paste
   it as a new file with this name format: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-ccsNNN.md`.
3. At the top of that file, add a header like this:
```
---
img: "NNN.jpg"
---
```
4. Save a poster jpg image (1200x675) to `assets/img/large/NNN.jpg`
5. Save a thumbnail (160x160 85% quality) to `assets/img/small/NNN.jpg`
6. Git: `commit` those 3 files then `push`.

The page will be built automatically using Jekyll and visible at
