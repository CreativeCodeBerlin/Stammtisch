**Articles and interviews**

- [Interview of James Faure Walker](http://www.imperica.com/en/in-conversation-with/james-faure-walker-digital-paint-and-praxis) about digital art (as in painting, not programming)
- [Interview with Moritz Stephaner](http://visualoop.com/19269/talking-with-moritz-stefaner) about data visualization which contains some useful insight about storytelling.
- A rant about post-internet art: [http://culturetwo.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/why-i-hate-post-internet-art/](http://culturetwo.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/why-i-hate-post-internet-art/)
- A missed one from February: the list of nominated artists for the [Prix Ars Electronica](http://www.imperica.com/en/news/prix-ars-electronica-golden-nica) in the [Creme de la Creme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIdTCFEmzxo) category.
- ... and an [interesting reaction](http://is.gd/7n7UVl) from Rafael Lozano-Hemmer on the “Pioneer and Visionnary” category which led the organizers to re-open the nomination process. 

The references were taking to much space so I opened another hackpad on the [history of computer art](https://hackpad.com/RpoBlhSbxrS#history-of-computer-art).
