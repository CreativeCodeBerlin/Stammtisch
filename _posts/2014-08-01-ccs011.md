[**Abe Pazos**](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/)
Abe explains how to create a library for Processing in only 5 minutes. Export a jar from eclipse (preferably with a constructor passing the PApplet as parent). Create a folder in your P5 libraries folder with the library name. in there the jar goes into the library folder (that's the structure of all p5 libraries). the cool thing: you only have to restart processing when you created the library- so you can constantly change it, without closing your sketch. 
[https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Library-Overview](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Library-Overview)
Note: I was surprised by how easy it is. The P5 documents are longs, and it makes it feel like complicated. You're supposed to include examples, src, reference... but it is all optional! (if the library is just for yourself ;) The only thing you need is libraries/MyLib/library/MyLib.jar In that jar, you either have static methods, or you pass the PApplet so you can access all Processing drawing functions. By having your own library you can share code among all your sketches, no need to copy paste functions/classes or use other tricks.

Performance tip. Reusing Objects instead of creating new ones all over the place is important for a fast running program. To guarantee this abe showed us his program, where he initialized final Vectors, that are used for 3D Animation calculation using toxiclibs. Instead of creating new Vectors anywhere else, he called the methods that don't return new vectors but operate on themselves. - he pointed out: sometimes they have a self in their name sometimes get....

Showed us his phone after stamping a vinyl-cut pattern on it, which he made at the Fab Lab Berlin. With Processing we can design and export vector shapes, and have them cut into very detailed stickers.

**School of Ma, Last chance to join! (August 4th - 29th)**
School of MA's summer program is an unforgettable experience. In the August session, you will learn physical computing (3D printing, Arduino, using motors, etc.) with some of the greatest people in creative tech: [http://schoolofma.org/programs/august-2014-let's-get-physical/](http://schoolofma.org/programs/august-2014-let's-get-physical/)

**Processing 3.0a1**
 Somebody tried the alpha of Processing 3.0?
 PDE X is much more stable then before. 
 But I don't get the change around sound? The New Sound Library doesn't work under Win64bit yet
* Did you try 3.0a2?
*yeah. the same issue
*Most of the sound examples don't work on my Mac either
