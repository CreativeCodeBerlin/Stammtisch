**IT Exhibition (5th of December)**
*"IT is a collaborative group show organized by the School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe and OpenTechSchool communities.  The objective of the event is to showcase works by community members that are both playful and experimental in the context of interactive art and technology. Participants will be working with the theme of ‘IT’ -- ‘Hear IT’, ‘Play IT’, ‘Wear IT’ are examples of the many whimsical interpretations which may manifest and unfold over the course of the event."*
