**Abe**
Subdivision of polygons in Processing with color palettes picked from photographs.
Human Output Device test: people simultaneously read text that is sent over websockets.

**Eric**
Asks for feedback on his interactive installation concept. 

**Micah**
Interactive visualization of the circle of fifths with a midi keyboard using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) in a web browser.
A visualization of some principles of music theory. He also uses [WebMidi](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-webmidi-20150317/), which is built on top of the [web audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), to use Midicontroller on the browser.

**Mo**
Inspired by the cymatics work Marcel presented at last month Stammtisch, he used a numerical approach to make it work with arbitrary shapes.

For reference, this is what cymatics can look like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3oItpVa9fs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3oItpVa9fs)

**MD**
Generative sound, samples and noise controlled with Arduino/distance sensor. Monks and pianos. Something with prime numbers. He uses Arduino, Processing, Max/MSP and supercollider.

Rain-activated messages and art
[http://rain.works/](http://rain.works/)
*I wonder how long it stays. I remember reading that Neverwet was rubbing off pretty easily.
*"How long do rainworks last?
*Each rainwork lasts about 4 months to a year, depending on the amount of foot traffic it has to endure. More abrasion means it will fade faster. A rainwork is the most vivid during its first couple of weeks, then slowly becomes more subtle."
*Apparently this is the product he uses: [http://nanexcompany.eu/always-dry.html](http://nanexcompany.eu/always-dry.html)
*Pretty cool!
*Wanna make some? :)
*He, why not? :) I'm wondering what other artistic uses of this coating we could think of... Like hydrophobic fountains? Or sculptures?
*I heard Hamburg had [some ideas](http://www.gizmag.com/st-pauli-pee-back-super-hydrophobic-walls/36424/).
*Definitely down for this
*I'd like to see the studies that prove it doesn't degrade in a way that's harmful for the environment.
*Nanocoating- that is for sure not environmentelfriendly or biodegradeable
