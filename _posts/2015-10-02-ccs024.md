“Bodily experience influence the way we think and act. The idea of the workshop alongside the exhibition 'Accessories in Algorithmic Gardens' was to explore how the materiality of our embodiment determines our perception of the world. Three collaborators were invited: Angela Balzano, Camilla Monga, and Zoe Romano.”
