**Peter**
Idea started at a Creative Code Jam. A way of showing photos at a gallery which is more engaging than with the usual still photos. The distance between you and the picture makes it sharper or more unfocused, so you need to move to experience the photo. Sound accompanies the photo, which also changes depending on the distance of the viewer. It uses 3 Raspberry Pi computers and a Kinect to control each image.
