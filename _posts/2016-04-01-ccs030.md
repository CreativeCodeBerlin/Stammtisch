[**Davide**](https://twitter.com/edapx)
Published two [openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) addons.

- [ofxLSystemGrammar](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystemGrammar) is a implementation for [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). It creates a string that represents an L system.
- [ofxLSystem](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystem) reads the strings created by the previous addon and draws them (the results are called trees) . It can also draw in 3D and draw multiple trees. See a video at [http://edapx.com/2016/04/01/l-system-addons/](http://edapx.com/2016/04/01/l-system-addons/)

[**Kris**](http://rijnieks.lv/)
Develops a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) [projection mapping addon](https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper) for openframeworks for [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), in an attempt to lower the cost of  mapping installations.... a study mentions that IT students graduating in UK had less understanding of hardware and software than a decade earlier, because they spent time using closed computing devices like game consoles and tablets. The solution was to develop a cheap mini computer to hack and experiment with.
He has tested his software with up to 10 videos on one Pi.

Lately interested in Photogrammetry. There's a software called [123dcatch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch) which you can use to build 3D models with your phone.

Here you can find scanned objects: [https://sketchfab.com/](https://sketchfab.com/)
He's been looking at objects from the inside, specially foods, which look like strange caves and worlds.
He got interested in those objects to create 3D worlds to be used as virtual reality landscapes. His example using Unity3D: [https://vimeo.com/160481128](https://vimeo.com/160481128)
It's possible to create 3D models from random photos taken by different people. So Kanno 3D printed a head of Justin Beaber reconstructed out of photos found online.
[ElectricObjects](https://www.electricobjects.com/) has an open call for media to be displayed on screen based digital art frames. Call ends today April 1st. Limit: 100Mb. 1080 x 1920. (Stills or videos).

Showed a [video](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/post/142066337932/at-the-sonic-code-session-11-at-spektrum-berlin) of  [Sonic Code Sessions](http://spektrumberlin.de/communities/sonic-code-sessions/about.html) ([@scsBLN](https://twitter.com/scsBLN) on twitter) session, in which all participants play sounds and write programs that forward messages around randomly, responding to each other and triggering more sounds. Participants used [Supercollider](http://www.audiosynth.com/) and OSC to communicate. The SCS event takes place every two weeks at Spektrum.

Discovered Rhizome a node.js application, which is a solution to transmit messages and files between applications running OSC (anything, like PD, Processing, openFrameworks, Max, Supercollider) and web pages accessed via mobile devices or laptops.

Shows a demo, which connects a webpage, Supercollider and a Processing sketch.

[Cereal Party](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/School-of-Machines-Making-Make-Believe/events/228081933/) event. 5 strangers, 5 minutes and a bowl of cereals. A discussion happens.
They wondered if to record it or not. They decided not, for privacy, but then people expected that it was recorded.

[Bugs and Machines](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/School-of-Machines-Making-Make-Believe/events/229636400/). A closer look at every day Aliens.

Asks for feedback on different projects, like free dinner where data is taken while you eat.
