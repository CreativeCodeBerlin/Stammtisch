[The virtual watchers](http://virtualwatchers.de/) - [http://virtualwatchers.de/](http://virtualwatchers.de/)

This project took five years of research. There was a border surveillance project, in which any citizen can watch the border with Mexico with a computer, and file reports to the authorities when they see something suspicious. Joana's project captures conversations between those people watching the border, and their profiles on Facebook (with fake pictures, for privacy reasons). Citizen are getting militarized without even realizing it through a gamified activity.
