**Abe**
Created an algorithm that creates an interesting tube.
[3 rule program](http://hamoid.tumblr.com/post/145852002189/unstable-rules-maintain-a-predefined-distance) to create the cross section:

- from each point maintain the distance to next
- from each point maintain the distance to the rest
- avoid sharp edges

the progress of the shape over time represent one step across the tube… LINKS!

**Gene** **Kogan**
Neural network generating images that match a “kind” of image (tea pots, running shoes, faces…).
The software creates new images that look like something recognizable, and it’s not a “mix” of previous images, but something new. It does this by looking at the probability distribution of many images of the target kind, and then tries to imitiate that distribution.

**Gerben**
Experimenting with creating a web-browser / note taking tool. Unifies bookmarks, tabs, history. Allows you to create notes and create links. It’s like a mind mapping tool.
