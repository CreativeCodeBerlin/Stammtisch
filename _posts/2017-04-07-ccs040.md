**Mo**
Goal: generating a realistic radio sound. Took an audio signal and did AM encoding/decoding by hand. Then “detuning” the signal to simulate radio. Idea is to build an audio plugin.

His project is about generating ‘[carved stone balls](https://www.google.de/search?q=carved+stone+ball&tbm=isch)’ in an interactive installation.

He also talked about his experiments applying recurrent neural networks on his drawings.
