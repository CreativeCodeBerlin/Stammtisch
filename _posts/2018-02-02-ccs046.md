**Costanze**
Shows her experiments on machine learning to generate rhythms. She trains a neural network with 1400 midi files to generate new music that is later played in Ableton Live.

**Saskia Freeke**
She started to create generative art in 2015-01-01. She’s posted 1129 results so far. She followed Joshua Davis’ Skillshare course. In the Bachelor she learned Processing. She was initially creating designs and loops with no coding. She was scared of showing the work online, thinking it’s not good enough. She was telling her students to experiment and play.
She started with Hexel and Illustrator, then Processing, Hype, OpenFrameworks, p5.js.
