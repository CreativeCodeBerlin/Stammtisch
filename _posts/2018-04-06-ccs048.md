Collaboration in a AR project with [Tartaruga Feliz](http://www.tartarugafeliz.com/) for [Pictoplasma](https://conference.pictoplasma.com/) festival in May. Shows his work in progress. An interactive story with a little green character.
About AR, currently itâ€™s a challenge to run an AR installation where people can move around, because of power consumption issues. About devices, it seems like the minimum is an iOS device for about 400 eur. Some Android devices work, but they might not be much cheaper.
