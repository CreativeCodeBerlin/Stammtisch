**Abe remotely** (announcement)
We have the opportunity to show an generative / interactive installation at Spektrum on July 6th, to celebrate the OpenTechSchool anniversary. The plan is to build sketches that can be interacted with mobile devices connected to a local wifi. Create simple (or complex) programs that receive one or more XY touch coordinates and produce visuals / sound. Let Abe know (https://hamoid.com/contact/) if you are interested in participating in such a project. Can be based on Processing / JavaScript / openFrameworks.
