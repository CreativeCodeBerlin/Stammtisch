# **June 1st, Stammtisch #50**

**Vivienne**
Shows her awareness-raising book about gender identity:
https://www.vivienneobrien.com/#/gender-identity/

**Joreg**
Shows a Telegram bot implemented in [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/), and demos receiving images from phones via Telegram. Also shows a screen of the new node system running inside his patch. 

**Constanze**
Demoes her music generation experiment created for the OpenTechSchool anniversary party coming in July in Spektrum. She used Ableton Live to generate the sound, MaxMSP receives data from phones via OSC. OSCHook is the app she made for this. The drum loops were generated using Machine Learning algorithms (RNN).

**Kris**
He made hardware. A 6 voice synthesizer. With a very low powered CPU, much simpler than an Arduino, he jokes such cpu should be inside tv remote controller. Since he last showed it, he added pitch bend and sustain. It’s using already about 1700 of the 2000 bytes of available memory.
Alternatves use atmega processor: Meeplip, 

**Charles**
Describes projection mapping and shows the projection mapping software in which he worked, called [Previz](https://previz.co/). He created the 3D pipeline, engine and the timeline driven by a JS dependency graph. The program is useful to simulate large stages with multiple screen and projection mapping setups, so visual artists can show their clients how things will look like in advance.

- Punto y Raya Festival https://www.puntoyrayafestival.com/ By creating an account in their website you get access to a curated list of over 700 videos (not all are viewable), many of them with generative computer graphics but also with other techniques like hand drawing or video compositing. Two examples: https://vimeo.com/9506884 and https://vimeo.com/146688667 Also: open call for abstract short films (deadline July 30th): https://www.puntoyrayafestival.com/en/blog/articles/18/3 Hinted by @Davide P 
- Open Call for OpenTechSchool party happening in July 6th 2018. We get the opportunity to show our work. We have a projector in the back room and speakers. The concept is to create collaborative pieces that can be controlled or played from mobile phones. A simple example: a collaborative drawing canvas, each player on a phone, and the result is projected, maybe sounds produced when drawing. Nuño during the last jam created this: https://github.com/CreativeCodeBerlin/OTSParty2018, a nodejs server which allows multiple participants connecting with a browser and interacting with each other. We can use it as a base for our projects.
- Shows a Processing based shader tool that automatically reloads shaders (for live coding), and creates a gui to control the shader’s uniforms. He developed this while working for http://ebosuite.com/, an Ableton Live Mac only program to do [audio AND video together](https://vimeo.com/ebosuite).
