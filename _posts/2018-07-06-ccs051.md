# **July 6th, Stammtisch #51**

On the 6th of July, our parent organization Open Tech School will host its 5 years anniversary party. We will therefore NOT host a
regular Stammtisch, but invite you all to join us at the OTS event where we will have a chance to talk about the past, present and future of our
meetup. Come meet us and the rest of the OTS community for an evening of celebration at Spektrum. https://spektrumberlin.de/events/detail/opentechschool-5-years-b-day-bash.html
