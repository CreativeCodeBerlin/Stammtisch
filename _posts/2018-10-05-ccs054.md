**David**
Shows an interactive map he worked on during a [one-week long hackaton](https://medium.com/@rosson/dhh18-the-week-long-hackathon-85d41a290a3) in Finland. It overlays an old map of London over the current map. It allows exploring the publisher’s world interactively with a time line, showing how they reappeared after a large fire that burned most of London. URL?

Also, time-based squatted map of Berlin: http://berlin-besetzt.de/
