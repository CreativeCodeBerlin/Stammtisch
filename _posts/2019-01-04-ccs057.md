**Selcuk**
He‚Äôs giving a course on creative coding in Istanbul. They use Processing but first start with compass, pen and paper. Shows examples created by his students, comparing an original and a ‚Äúremix‚Äù created digitally. ‚ÄúRecipher - Student Works‚Äù was featured in Creative Applications.

**Constanze**
Shows a machine learning project that generates pictures (using pix2pix). She trained a model using 50 photos of pumpkins, which she labeled herself (painted with flat colors on top of pumpkin photos to show background, wholes with light, without light, pumpkin. Then she created new flat-color images to let the network create a pumpkin out of them, creating funny examples of logos or buses converted to pumpkin-like images.

**Leo**
Shows a class to make random 2D mazes using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (in Python language). But it also works on any number of dimensions. The maze can be played as a musical sequence. Jupyter nicely shows the musical score in the middle of the code.

**Felix**
Had an [OP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Engineering_OP-1) synth which he liked a lot, but it broke. After waiting for the repair for one year, he decided to code his own sequencer. It rotates a Hexagon with balls inside, moved by a physics engine. https://github.com/fjl/opseq
