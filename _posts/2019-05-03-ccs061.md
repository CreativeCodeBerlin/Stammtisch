OPENRNDR
A creative coding framework using the Kotlin programming language, published last year. Modern, with examples, good documentation, small community, has a live coding mode, allows low level access to the graphics pipeline, lets you inline shader code in your program…

Here some example videos: https://vimeo.com/rndrstudio and a demo made with OPENRNDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r1732c04aY

And a quick introduction what shaders are, showing https://shadertoy.com and http://shdr.bkcore.com/

Uses the pressurejs.com library.

A library to filter noisy signals while limiting latency, great for live noisy user generated data.

**Stef**

Shows his project “Immersive Computing”
http://steftervelde.nl/immersive_computing
and talks about the new version he is building in Unity to let people build virtual computers, and a physical version using metal beams and 3D printed joints, so it can be easily assembled and disassembled. He would welcome help from engineers who can help designing the joints.
