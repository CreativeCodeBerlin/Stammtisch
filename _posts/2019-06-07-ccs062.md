**aBe**

Presents *Ratkaisu*. A collaborative mesh generator where the decisions of the participants shapes the final sculpture.

> Ratkaisu is a virtual 3D sculpture that explores how unique our decisions actually are, how they can be influenced, what are our biases, and to what extent free will is an illusion. Ratkaisu attempts to employ tricks used by advertisers, politicians and magicians, and explores the use of those tricks to manipulate the decision making process.

**Cristian**

https://elkraneo.micro.blog/categories/wie-shaders
Trained in classical art and painting, recently has been working with shaders to understand computer graphics. Wants to create a system to produce shaders.
He’s figured out how to create cool looking effects, but producing intentional shapes has been very hard. Now he has a set of snippets for sublime that help him produce predictable results (like lines, squares, segments, etc). They will be shared in GitHub.

Hobby: collect old computers. Shows an old laptop running Windows 98.
He’s been using Processing for 12 years and recently p5.js.
He demos Processing-inspired system in MS-DOS. It has a DOS based editor with syntax highlighting. With integrated help system. Designed for +100Mhz Pentium. But also runs on 386 computer. https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS It took him half year.

Announcement: last week of February, Commodore 64 demo party in Berlin.

**Rachel**

https://schoolofma.org
A few years ago she organized a meetup about math and graphics with Raphael and Ramin.
5 years ago she started the School of Machines, Making and Make Believe.
She presents the coming courses for this summer. Art and technology with a focus on what they are trying to express and a human/social aspect.
She wants to highlight two courses called *Money* (From the history of Money and Finance to Blockchain and Crypto) and *Evidence* (Citizen forensics - a investigative tool for bringing things to light).
Some instructors for *Waiting and Escaping* come from:

Next Monday: [meetup with Gene Kogan](https://mobile.twitter.com/genekogan/status/1130483965167583232) where he will present a project about creating an artificial artist (AI / Machine Learning related).

**Kazik**
I mentioned my meditation on machine color models, I just wrote a short article about it:
https://medium.com/@kazikpogoda/not-so-discreet-charm-of-machine-colors-1390d4dba3db

A researcher contacted him about a creating therapeutic software (multi-sensory integration). He realized a user in a wheel chair was trying to use the software.
He demos a software with a particle system that also produces audio, inviting users to explore and move.
A different project: Angels In America. He was contacted for creating visuals for a stage piece. A projection behind an opera singer gives her animated angel wings and other effects as she moves and waves her arms.

**Tony**

https://mikage.app (will be open in ~2 weeks)
He’s been creating a 3DS emulator to run the portable console games once the gaming console is no longer available. This way the games will not be lost.
He shows the internals (assembly code and C++ code).
He got it working 6 months ago (it took several years).
He’s sharing progress at https://twitter.com/fail_cluez and https://twitter.com/MikageEmu
Looking for a new challenge, he made them also work not only on Desktop but also on an Android mobile device.
There’s a website documenting the 3DS: https://3dbrew.org

**Gilbert**

https://instagram.com/autr.tv
Shows an edited segment of an audiovisual performance from earlier this year, using old school analog hardware (vintage equipment).
First time he used a Raspberry Pi on a live performance. He writes code using OpenFrameworks for it. The good things about it is that you can have analog input and output on a Pi computer, and it’s cheap.
The system uses video feedback.
