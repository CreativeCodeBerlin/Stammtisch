# **August 9th, Stammtisch #64**

Today as a new introductions format, we had 10 minutes to talk to people we don’t know.

**Lisa**
Little project she finished about Fragment Shaders (programs that run in the graphics card instead of the CPU). All about pixel colors, set by a very fast program. Written in ClojureScript. It’s a web based / terminal environment. She writes code in the terminal, the browser window shows the running graphics and shader source code to the audience.
Repository with the code: https://gitlab.com/lislis/figfrag

**Nuño**

Secret art-tech event in a mystery location. This will be the 2nd edition. Nuño showed two invite QR codes for people to register.

**Rosi**
[https://nodeforum.org](https://nodeforum.org/)

Showing cool stuff you can do in the new version of [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) (a node based visual programming language and multipurpose toolkit), for example 1. a “character packing” algorithm that fits letters in a rectangle avoiding overlapping, 2. the multilevin example (see Golan Levin), 3. a particle system represented by classes / objects.

Today they had a workshop on computer vision, they used printed paper marker. Shows an example in which he rotates a marker, but the software inverses the transformations so it’s always shown as perpendicular to the camera.

**Alma**
Shows her audio reactive visuals done in TouchDesigner. She played them in live situations. It was harder than expected, because settings had to be tweaked depending on the music.
