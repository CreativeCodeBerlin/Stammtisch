Collecting data that would be useful for artistic interpretation in a dance performance.
Can you measure when the performers get in the flow
Workshop with dancers equipped with wearables (full body suits with stretch sensors built in + microphones and heart monitors). Had to be robust enough to be able to roll on the floor with it.
Gilbert recommends [ZED](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed/) depth cameras
