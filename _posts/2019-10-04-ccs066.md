**Nuño** - https://action-io.com/ https://www.instagram.com/action.io/
Talks about his approach to work. Mentions that he doesn’t so far done a great job at communicating how he works, the process. 

Today he tries to describe two of his projects:

1. A present he made. A poster with a collection of memories. He made it tracing outlines of images that had meaning for him and his friends. He later used part of the tool he built for creating the poster in a different project in which drones make graffities in walls. https://action-io.com/post/154933220678/20161123-berlin-memory-trace-map-of-berlin https://dronegraffiti.tumblr.com/
2. He observed a pattern of water in the window, learned that it’s reproduceable with a reaction-diffusion algorithm. Then he created such algorithm in [cables.js](https://cables.gl/):

**Imanol Gómez**
Next week he will give this talk at Porto Tech Hub 2019: *Expressive Generative Lighting*
Introduction to lighting design concepts like temperature. First mentioning natural lighting (the sun), then artificial. Imanol is interested in how to do storytelling with light.
Explains how controlling stage lights digitally using the [DMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) and [ArtNet](https://art-net.org.uk/) protocols.
Now you don’t need to be an expert to control stage lights. You just need a laptop. 
You can control lights with a texture or a video in [MadMapper](https://madmapper.com/).
