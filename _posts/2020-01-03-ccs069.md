**Michael**

[https://vimeo.com/364093321](https://vimeo.com/364093321)
Worked with performers. Created a web based tool that uses a web cam to track dancer amount-of-movement. The system synthesizes sound. Everything written in JavaScript with p5.js.
Asks about how to share an application (ship it)  to the performers. Stef suggests using Electron: https://electronjs.org/

**Kazik**

Has been working in Dream World https://dreamworld.space 
Shows https://vimeo.com/380148095, a dancer testing Kazik’s interactive visuals.
Mentions that people dancing in clubs don’t enjoy the slow visuals, so he’s created a new one that reacts faster and has more variety.

**Stef, Minna, Ernesto**

Presenting “Consimity”, her final project HZT / UDK. She had a “cold” relationship to tech. She explored how tech changes the perception of the self, how it influences us. She collaborated with Stef (tech) and Ernesto (sound).

They show videos of the 3-part performance in which Minna has two “alternative digital personalities” which she interacts with. Who tells who what to do?

**Ernesto**

He created a live sound performance using Max/MSP including recordings of women telling their heart-breaking stories about traveling on roads in South America. Ernesto performs the 7 minute piece. It’s generative, and every time it is performed it changes.
