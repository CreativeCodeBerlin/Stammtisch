Showing a text based rendering thing he made. First still, then animated.
Runs in the browser. Converting photos to text, but also algorithmic noise.

Converted fonts using filters to damage the fonts, then converted them back to
a font. Affected by reaction diffusion.

Used https://www.fontself.com/ to convert the images to a font (for Illustrator).

**Kazik**
Was contacted by a friend asking about who can build a robot, so
he said he would do it. A robot carries around a pico projector in the club.
Found a project for converting vacuum cleaners into hackable robots.
Carries a Raspberry Pi & a power converter. The Pi overrides the computer
in the vacuum cleaner and gets access to the sensors.
