**Kazik**
Presents the latest version of his website: https://xemantic.com/
including full screen shader effects.

Toolchain for optimizing and minimazing/obfuscating shaders:
 * First: https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer
 * Second: https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier
 * Closure compiler - JavaScript to JavaScript transpiler (type checking + dead code removal + inlining + minimization): https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler

**Samarth**
Presents optical illusions he has animated. They are known optical illusions, he interpolated the design to reveal the parts that produce the illusion.

He's been trying out Nannou, the Rust-based creative coding environment. His initial plan was to try produce webassembly results, but they don't support it yet.
-> maybe arturo knows about it http://arturocastro.net/ (naoto)
-> with openFrameworks (C++) you can target webassembly (aBe)

**Ilu**
Has been experimenting with Processing and webcams. We watch live demos.
https://twitter.com/dec_hl

Progress on his ms-dos Processing clone, adding serial port support. Shows an Arduino generating a sine wave, which goes through rs232 portr into the old PC, and ms-dos Processing visualizes the moving curve in real time.

**Constanze**
Shows her reinforced learning project. It's a simulation system which is runs time over time again, each time evaluating the algorithm. The goal is to produce a system that grows and includes decline too. There are physics, boxes, a few circles (all affected by gravity) and a sun beam that makes the circles grow. The algo and the framework are from OpenAI: https://github.com/openai/gym

**Announcements**

*Coming events? Need help?*

- Kazik could help convert web sites into fancy ones with shaders and webgl, dataviz, can do backend. @KazikPogoda in Twitter. email: morisil@xemantic.com
- Naoto (tw: @naoto_hieda) on a panel about digital dancing on Monday (free but needs registration) http://tolovein.com/digital-dancing-fcpp/
- Naoto2: Open calls at NRW forum (which Naoto is part of) https://www.nextmuseum.io/en/
- Naoto3: Processing Hangout (july 11, related to education) http://ccfest.rocks/
- Naoto4: Hydra meetup (August 1st) - more to come
- Elias happy to help any creative coding oriented project with web extensions: e.g. https://github.com/nestarz/femmage ( contact me on twitter https://twitter.com/eeeeeeeeeexee )

**Victor**
Shows the latest version of PHONK https://phonk.app/ , a simple coding environment for Android devices. Demoes a bunch of its features, like accessing Processing, Puredata, sensor input, simple machine learning training based on webcam input (for example), and much more.
Go star it on Github! ⭐️ https://github.com/victordiaz/PHONK ⭐️

**Eric**
Shows a project made with Elliy for her class at Weimar University. Voice controlled interface based on a Teensy microcontroller connected to a computer. Using k-means clustering to classify sounds (only two for now but could work with more). "Woof or Miaw" a game to teach you how to recognize cats and dogs. If you see a pic of a cat you have to go "miaw", if you see a pic of a dog, you have to go "woof".

Collaborative doodle. One person doodles something -> A second writes a description of the drawing -> A third person writes a generative program based on the description.
