**Nuño**
1) Collecting stories and anectodes about the BVG (Berlin Transportation Authority) for an installation in September. The BVG as a cultural icon of Berlin.

2) Light mapping
A technique common in big heavy game engines but not so common in Creative Coding Frameworks. Calculates the shadows in a 3D scene and bakes them into textures. Not real-time but quite fast. Good for ambient occlusion and bounces.

Sensor's charts rendering by MSDOS
DOjS now has WATTCP (Waterloo TCP) support

**Doug**
Dough is working on Dali, a new kind of graphics API, based on signed distance fields, built with WebGPU
https://github.com/dali3d/dali   
Dali uses an extensible 2D/3D graphics model that goes far beyond postscript/SVG.
Same graphics possibilities as Curves but new implementation made for high performance and fast rendering. Wanna be able to render millions of characters on the screen and make zoomable UI or do deformations on text (e.g. fisheye).
