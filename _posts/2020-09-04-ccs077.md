**Ilu**
VirtualBox running freeDos. Connecting with TPC on MS-DOS using Javascript. Used an HTTP stack already available for DOS systems. On top of it, Ilu implemented a web server with Javascript on MS-DOS. REST API is implemented too.
Next up, Ilu will look into 3DFX.

Twitter: @annabelchurch
https://pudding.cool/ is a data journalism essay newsroom/organisation. They take interesting datasets and they analyse, visualise them, and explain their process, their assumptions and why they did the visualisations that they did. For example, they took all the Disney movies and did an analysis of the dialogs from a gender perspective.

Bell has a personal project about the 70s and 80s activism that her mother did about domestic violence reporting in NZ. Scanned all of her documents (took 2 years), extracted the text, and looking to do text analysis from those. Look at how the language changes over time. How the feminist movement changed the culture of the country
11 years of newspaper clippings, draft documents to change the laws, correspondance with the police, TV, audio interviews that her parents did. Now looking for ways to transcribe the speech.

Powered by magnum engine, emscripten and box2d. Source code is available (https://bitbucket.org/constanze/hiroki/src/master/)

Samarth: reminds me of https://ncase.me/polygons/
Coleran says the topic reminds him of the book On Mass Movement by Eric Hoffer

Showing his setup for livecoding. Improviz (https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz)
Found a really cool tool by the maker of BookOfShaders: MidiGyver (https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/MidiGyver) a console program to convert MIDI inputs into OSC.
