# **December 4th, Stammtisch #80**

(22 attendees online at least)

**Jean-Michael**
Lead dev of Ossia Score and libossia. Wants to talk about languages. He also created libmapper: library for connecting things (languages, sensors)
https://vimeo.com/423615656
webassembly: browser technology, allows you to compile programs written in C++, C and others and run it in the browser, likely fast (instead of the typical browser language which is JavaScript).
libossia includes shaders, Faust-based audio generation.

J-M wonders if WebAssembly would make sense as glue language to connect creative coding languages, frameworks, platforms, etc?

**Ilu**
Took a photo of Ella (the cat), loaded it into Processing and used the brightness as an elevation map, finally 3d printed it. That was a first proof of concept and it worked well enough.

**Gabor**
Inspired by the work of Mohit Bhoite http://bhoite.com/sculptures a "perpetual motion machine" but got sidetracked in many side-rabbit-holes. One was to create one of those cats (maneki neko) inviting you to enter a store, built with an ATtiny microcontroller. It has a capacitor to continue operating after the sunset.

**Naoto**
He's been using glitch.com to host his web experiments.
One of them is a virtual gallery:
https://glitch.com/~hydra-exhibition
The "paintings" hanging in the walls of the gallery are actually hydra programs running, not just images or videos.

Another of his creations:

One more: a wiki style page:

**Announcements**

- Onat wants a job in 5 months. Can help you with Not Invented Here. He likes to reinvent. But should not involve JavaScript or C++. He's on Twitter: @...?
- Abe: will get "The Three Body Problem" for x-mas. Maybe also The Dispossessed by Ursula K Leguin.
- Naoto: Madrid processing meetup 12.12. https://twitter.com/CCodeMadrid/status/1331985086024200196
- Naoto: Hydra meetup 12.12. http://hydra-meetup-3.glitch.me/
- Tony: Needs AMD graphics cards (anything released 2012 or after): https://twitter.com/fail_cluez

**Bruce**
He has a fork of Hydra, websockets too to share shaders with a C++ application (VideoDrome) which he also wrote.
Runs on mobile with the Ionic React framework.
He uses Syphon (mac) / Spout (win) to share gpu textures between programs.

**Raph**
Has worked in AR/VR before, then been creating filters using Spark AR https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/
modeled golden body parts in Blender
screaming glsl filter, interlacing and glitch effect

He's been drawing lots of birdies in different scenes. On his Twitter: https://twitter.com/sableraph

**Roman**
Created a web based interactive 3D space in glitch:
https://almostathome.glitch.me/ The space is like a zoo with creatures that behave in different ways. The creatures are created based on a name given by the users. He doesn't show the name in the space because it would break the feel of it.

**Abe**
https://editor.p5js.org/abe/sketches/qqSFfuj9_l created a tweet with p5js + shaders for the Madrid event (find #tinycodein Twitter). It was veery hard to make it fit.
