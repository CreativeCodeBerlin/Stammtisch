# **January 1st, Stammtisch #81**

(about 15 attendees)

**Naoto**
Shows a numpad-like keyboard with LEDs made by Pimoroni. Includes a RaspberryPi Zero. Configurable by placing a LUA script into the device. The hardware has a wifi, but it's unused.
This is their repo: https://github.com/pimoroni/keybow-firmware 
Someone forked the repo and tried to improve it but did not get feedback from the original developers: https://github.com/TheDiveO/multibow
Naoto was asking for ideas on how to distribute a potential software he would create for that device, and how the wifi could  be made configurable for users in a simple manner.
Idea from abe: https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblazegettingstarted

**Andrey**
Talks about creating a mobile dating app, different to traditional ones. "blind dating". Very minimal, not gathering user data like photos, age, interests..., only e-mail.
Here is a description of the project:
https://andreyustinov.com/p/possiblerendezvous/
Andrey is looking for team members to write that app.

**Kazik**
Browser as a creative coding environment
https://xemantic.github.io/shader-web-background/
https://github.com/xemantic/shader-web-background
Presents his recently released library to enable shader backgrounds on websites.
Async shader compilation example https://github.com/FMS-Cat/glcat-ts/blob/936a8580664f5e85a87bd4d3ddd4a91d4f10c578/src/GLCatProgram.ts
Depends on: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KHR_parallel_shader_compile
Added to relatively recent versions of browsers, might be nice as an option but it seems that shader compilation is not a bottlenceck here.
