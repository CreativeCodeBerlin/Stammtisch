[https://openframeworks.cc/](https://openframeworks.cc/)

Arturo talks about crypto-art and the history of software copyright, and describes how giving exclusive property of files is at the opposited side of the spectrum when compared to free open source software.

He tries to raise the topic of how do we pay artists.

**Gabor**

Gabor has been working on a Pinyin + Chinese text editor. When you type it keeps both Pinyin and the Chinese characters visible and selectable, which is very useful for learning. It allows multiple users edit in real time, based on the protocol used by Etherpad'.

**Pinyin is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China**
