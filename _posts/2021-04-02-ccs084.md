**Sandro**

Worked with Processing and other non-web technologies before, but because of staying more at home, he switched to p5.js projects. He shows two of them:



1. Pixel based mandalas, working on Hic et Nunc. It uses the public key of the viewer to generate a unique pattern. [https://sandromiccoli.github.io/crypto/pixel\_mandala/](https://sandromiccoli.github.io/crypto/pixel\_mandala/)

2. Platonic shapes, solid or wireframe, rendered with Blender and then processing using ML algorithms to style them in interesting ways. [https://sandromiccoli.github.io/crypto/latent\_solids/](https://sandromiccoli.github.io/crypto/latent\_solids/)

**Onat**

Talks about creating an alternative to Hic et Nunc, or a forum for discussions around art and possible ways to work as a creative / artist, and his plans to release some of his work on HeN.



**Kathryn**

Show the result of a program that generates a binary pattern (zeros and ones) combined with the image of a lotus flower. When creating it she noticed there's an issue in p5.js with hyphenation. So she fixed it and sent a pull request on GitHub. Her first contribution to the framework.

Text wrapping function should be included in next release -> [https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/5146](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/5146) 

Second, she got an invite to use the GPT-3 text-processing machine learning platform. "Ask the mystical magic 8-ball". She can not show the results to larger groups of people. She thinks GPT-2 is better for creative purposes because it can be fine tuned, unlike version 3.



**Alma**

Show work in progress using Touch Designer. It uses the webcam as input and creates some kind of wavy noisy landscape. Actually a bug, but she finds it beautiful. She wants to achieve a painting-like aesthetic / pointillism.

**Gero**

Generative designs limited to circles and a few colors (using POVray). Shows hundreds of iterations while approaching the final results.

**Ilu**

Presents the latest version of DOjS (1.50) and shows a Birb example running on DOS, then experiments using Perlin and Simplex noise, first pure JavaScript (slow) and then using a loaded library (faster). Ilu says there are at least 3 users of his framework, himself included (more downloads but no errors reported).
