   * [https://twitter.com/HedronApp](https://twitter.com/HedronApp) The **Hedron App** is an upcoming 3D editor using equilateral polyhedra. 


   * [https://twitter.com/GirihApp/media](https://twitter.com/GirihApp/media) The **Girih App** uses equilateral polygons to draw designs. "a pattern fanatic’s dream." ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih\_tiles)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih\_tiles))


   * [https://twitter.com/ZelligeApp/media](https://twitter.com/ZelligeApp/media) The **Zellige App** is a macOS software for puzzling moroccan mosaics with Zellige tiles. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellige)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellige))

Update on his MS-DOS based creative coding framework DOjS:

- Shows new blend modes. 

- Two new plugins: ogg-vorbis and mpeg1 playback.

- Live coding from a second computer in the same network.



DOjS GitHub ([https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS)](https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS)) with binary releases ([https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS/releases)](https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS/releases))

Trillipses:

[https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1341143](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1341143)

   * Shows a generative piece with circles and triangles, with controllable opacity and a trail-effect. Made in p5.js.
Leveled Circles:

   * Also a pattern inspired by designs on a bathroom's wall, which then evolved into different versions with colors and lines. Shapes arranged in a grid with levels used to determine the larger shapes/color (repeats every 4 levels). Markov Chain used to mirror image's distribution.
Colored Circles:

   * One more sketch with a collection of circles of different sizes rotating around the center and being displaced by a random vector. Circles return to starting radius after a certain amount of time.
Vector Field:

   * Vector field controls movement of points (stars), planets, and lines around a rotating center (black hole). Line width and hue is relative to distance from center (black hole). Black hole moves to mouse (with easing) when clicking and holding.
   * Using: [https://github.com/SYM380/p5.pattern](https://github.com/SYM380/p5.pattern)
More code will be shared after I (eventually) mint those pieces.



**Tom**

[http://www.tooll.io/](http://www.tooll.io/)

He spent some time working on his VJ set, in which he used live patching.

Including generative patterns and also cassette-tape slit-scanning-y designs. Another design he created involves a collection of faces which he aligned manually, so he could split the screen in two showing two different faces.

Asks the question: is a meme art? can it be art? Where can you draw the line (if there is one)

-> Lead to interesting thoughts like memes as "Internet Street art" and how the joke about hiding the link to the "Ahah Get Ralph-ed" gives it a meaning. Talking about 'good practices online' with a fun way to learn (like what la Fontaine would do in his Fables, learn throught stories and "fun")

Asks about code golfing

Then continues as one more episode of "bed time stories".
