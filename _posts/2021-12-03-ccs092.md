**Chris**

Turns picture (a photo collage) into low-res monochrome; converts to a pixel displacement of the original image based on brightness. Effect is a seemingly organic dissolution of the image. Like a flow field.

Used openFrameworks to process [https://openframeworks.cc/](https://openframeworks.cc/)

**Xavier**

Shows a large collection of Processing sketches. 

Sketches inspired by a leaf growth simulation paper: [http://www.algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf](http://www.algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf)

But then I tend to deviate from the original algorithm to get something new



3D looking distortion

Yes, it's just a flat 2D grid distortion in the same plane, even if it's in a shader. It was just a lucky finding. Same for the lighting : more light in the center of the distorsion



**Josh**

Shows one-off portfolio, moving from visual arts into landscape architecture

Light positioned 1 mile away flickers to your voice, spoken into a walkie-talkie

Site-specific art
