She took a break in London to come to Berlin and join the School of Machines, Making and Make Believe.

There she developed a project called Wind Radio. It's a public installation based on a wind sock. It plays radio stations depending on where the wind is blowing from, and how strong it is.

Part of the installation was 3D printed. She shows making-of photos and videos.

**Jiwa xx **

Presented the Televangelist last time. Satirical piece. He's presenting today the sonification aspect he added to the work. The sound includes voices from old televangelist recordings manipulated using tone.js.

Then he shows various experiments on pixel manipulation which ended up as part of an interactive installation which is controlled via an interface built into a physical book. The book contains an arduino, a power bank, a wifi chip and a light bulb.

**Juan Pablo**

Visual artist and film maker from Colombia, visiting Berlin for the School of Machines: [https://www.schoolofma.org/](https://www.schoolofma.org/)

His work relates to plants and language. Mycellium connects mushrooms and trees. Underground communication, the Internet of plants. He wanted to create a mushroom out of street posters that reacts to touch and produces light and sound.

For the top of the mushroom he used a transparent plastic that can be heated and shaped.

A Bela microcontroller takes care of playing sound and controlling LEDs.



**Stef**

Not technically creative coding.

Wanted to 3D print a K67 kiosk. But there was no model. He found one in Berlin and measured it, then printed version one, then version two featuring black lines.

Needs help with selling, taxes, marketing in Germany.
