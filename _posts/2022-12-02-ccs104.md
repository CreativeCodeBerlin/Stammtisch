**Sarah**

Was spending time in subway stations looking at how the seconds-needle in clock moves.

She recreated the clock using mostly css transitions

**Deniz**

Was inspired by things she saw in a recent Stammtisch. 

Simulated paper marbling (ebru / suminagashi)

Found a paper related to paper marbling and the related mathematics.

[http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin/cga2012/mmarbling.pdf](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin/cga2012/mmarbling.pdf)

Then she tried programming the behavior, first with Unity and compute shaders, which didn't work so well. Then switched to the CPU side which did work.

Then re-started the project in p5.js and made it work there.

Then went into creating an interactive-tutorial-page explaining the technique.

**Louis**

Mentions Obsidian, a software that features nodes you can connect to each other.

Created a plugin called obsidian-ava to do funny things with GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion

It can correct his grammar, complete sentences and convert texts into images.

His plugin makes calls to the stability.ai API (paid).

**Stef**

In 2014 he was in school. A Professor challenged the students to make the computer something physical. He created a working computer in Minecraft. Later he placed that computer in VR in a 3D space as part of an installation.

He has retaken the project and shows the computer computing inside Unity (counting numbers). Shows an editor he has created to build the computer inside the IDE.

In the future he might create a game out of it.



**Josh**

Two years ago he got into NLP. He created a system to review images created by ML systems. Trained with thousands of art reviews scraped from the Internet.

Also shows videos that use drone footage in Tempelhof, top-down as input. The images are very line-based, geometrical. He processes them with a tool Go-based called "primitive", later to become a music-video.



**Nikita**

Wants to share a high-level tool he's using: [https://cables.gl](https://cables.gl)

Shows generative artworks he created, for instance one that converts a 3D mesh of a human head into an abstract rotating shape. Demonstrates that visuals and sound can be connected when using Cables.
