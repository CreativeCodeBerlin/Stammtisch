**Alessandro**

Inspired by Deniz in a previous meetup where "marbling" was introduced, a shader attempt, then in p5.js. He wrote it using fragment shaders in OPENRNDR (Kotlin).

By applying image warping multiple times things become blurry. The paper in which the code was based explained a solution, but after trying to do it he realized it was not fun because it wouldn't be surprising. So he tried creating many simultaneous textured drops painting with a regular rhythm. Then iterated to add some kind of lighting.



**Nikita**

Using cables.gl, a node based web environment for visual experimentation. He used a midi interface to control the visuals. Shows a system with many particles. By not clearing the screen on update, the particles paint on the screen like a brush.

After that experiment he tried using a 3D model as source of particles.

A third patch he created used an animated running 3D character.

In Mixamo one can find usable animated 3D characters.



**Josh**

He built a cube-shaped synthesizer with acrylic layers, knobs and a Teensy to produce the sound. The code is created with a patching environment by Teensy. He found a tape in a second hand shop that contained the voice of someone complaining about the tv and playing guitar. That sound became part of his instrument. He makes a short and noisy performance with the instrument.

**== announcements ==**



- Community of Processing learners may join next time.

- @alesame (on Creative code Telegram) Starting a project to facilitate installing software for workshops.

- (Looking for flat)

- We can show our work: Tuesday January 24th in the Lighthouse (near Warshauerstr.) we have the opportunity to show our work in two formats: A) 4K large, high contrast vertical displays, B) projection room with 37 projectors. For showing generative videos on the 4K displays, contact @hamoid or [https://mastodon.art/@hamoid](https://mastodon.art/@hamoid) For the large projection, join (in Telegram) "Ctm vorspiel 2023 @lighthouse"

- Introductory Processing courses at the volkhochschule. We can join for low price :)

**Nuño**

He's trying to be more awary of where the materials of his art pieces come from, and what happens to them afterward.

Nuño researched the production of biodegradable art, made out of rice. He created tiles and left them outside for a year, but they didn't fall apart. The second iteration included seeds mixed in the piece, so they would grow when exposed to water.



**Tom (Pixtur)**

Has worked for years on a node based environment: [http://www.tooll.io/](http://www.tooll.io/)

He meets once per month with the lead developer from cables.gl and compare what is missing on each. He's been working on text rendering this time: text sprites.

The new text module has 3 inputs. He demos creating a million letters floating in space, with randomized motion and orientation in 3D.

Also 3D loads a model and positions letters all over the surface of the model.

Last addition to the framework is motion blur, which can be heavy but looks very nice, useful especially when exporting video frames to produce a video.
