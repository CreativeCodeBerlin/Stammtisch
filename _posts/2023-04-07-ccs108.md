**Rita**

Shares graduation project as a creative technologist: A friendly introduction to Creative Coding through Analog Techniques

Started from her own feeling of not "getting" coding. Interviewed other people who come from a non-coding background. Developed a thesis on how to make coding more accessible, including by analog techniques.

Asks for advice on how to get rich and famous with a book.



If you wanna be a tester for the book, Rita is interested in feedback. Contact: eperjesirit@gmail.com



**Martyna**

Martina is a Developer and Creative Coder working on visuals

The Blob Story: Inspired by slime mold

[https://martynachojnacka.com/project/creative/blob/](https://martynachojnacka.com/project/creative/blob/)

Started with some renders then built a solid frame covered in lycra fabric made with 3D printed joints. Internal mechanism driven by Arduino

tried different materials, went from lycra to liquid latex

Blob reacts to people nearby (and terrifies some children)

Cymatics: Water mixed with soy sauce, reacts to a speaker underneath. Live performance with Szczeczin Philharmony.

**Sebastian**

Joined the Tiny Code Christas challenge last December. Got inspired by a creative coding tutorial for Rust so started with Rust. Programmed many variations on cubes!

Rust creative coding framework: Nannou [https://nannou.cc/](https://nannou.cc/)

Semi-practical application: visualize notes played on a harmonica

**Matthi**

Discovered creative coding through Generative Gestaltung, and then Touch Designer, to which he is addicted. Now does a sketch 2 days each week.

Now moved on to building one website each day. Then one GLSL sketch a day. (but also leads to burnout)

Currently creating one thing a week: [https://matthiasmeissen.substack.com/](https://matthiasmeissen.substack.com/)

**Gabor**

Doing distance fields graphics hatched for plotting.

Gabor explores techniques for plotting 3D scenes using shaders.

Using twglJS as WebGL minimal framework [https://twgljs.org/](https://twgljs.org/)

Gabor found inspiration on papers like Suggestive Hatching to desing a solution to draw lines and edges following the surface of the shapes with flow fields.

The pipeline is a 1st past with raymarching, 2nd pass with surface normals, 3rd pass with lighting. Based on the pixel information, then build the flow lines in GPU so the lines can be converted into plottable coordinates.
