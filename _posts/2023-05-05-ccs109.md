## Presentations part 1



**Johannes**

Shows his first creative coding experiments involving rotating lines, written with Python. He enjoys doing data visualization. Shows a visualization of sleep patterns, represented as a spiral. One turn represents one day. He finds inspiration in Pinterest.



**Tom aka Pixtur**

For about 8 months has been obsessed with optical illusions and wanted to use the topic to create a Demo (a few minutes long audiovisual piece). It uses over a hundred compute shaders, and it was created with his own www.tooll.io

Video capture of the demo: [https://youtu.be/ODrlK3u5Hzc](https://youtu.be/ODrlK3u5Hzc)



**Nikita and Hannah**

They made a project about **Marinka** / **Maryinka**, a Ukranian city which no longer exists.

They applied pixel displacement and other effects in the www.cables.gl web-based tool for audiovisual projects. The sound was created controlling ableton live while looking at the rendered video.



Inspiration: Pavlo Makov



**Sonja**

Talks about her plan to get rid of HR.

**Yanzhu**

"Shadow and the Dancer" - [https://xdudu.github.io/shadow-and-the-dancer/#/](https://xdudu.github.io/shadow-and-the-dancer/#/)

Presents 6 iterations of her subtle generative artwork.

She also tried this project with a pen plotter and very much enjoyed the results.



**Samantha Tiussi**

She can see shapes when she hears sound (Synesthesic)

[https://vimeo.com/798337095](https://vimeo.com/798337095) - "Creatures" inspired by the sound of glass

"Pianoglass" a prepared piano including pieces of glass, automated with Arduinos and motors.



In the current piece there's two creatures having conflicts, controlled by multiple Arduinos and stepper motors. She is wondering how the creatures should interact with each other and with the audience. How can we understand other creatures if we have trouble even communicating with other humans?



SIDE NOTE: Samantha didn't give any credits during her presentation but she has not been the one coding this installation at first. As she said, the glass first dancers and glass piano working with Arduinos were produced during TheLab² but she never said Marina Avila (from the Creative Code Berlin community!) coded the whole Arduino system back then. Samantha had already a bit of troubles crediting the work of Marina back then...



SIDE NOTE 2: I would like to apologise to Marina and the community. Presenting the project was a very challenging situation for me, I didn't have a presentation ready, and it's not something that I do often. I would like to acknowledge and thank all the amazing people that contributed in several ways to the development of my project - I wouldn't had arrived that far without you.



THANKS TO

**Quote from Pierre Depaz Website: we re-consider justice as "love with open eyes."**

this means that we assume everyone is trying the best they can reasonably be asked to, and we do not expect less than that from anyone. perhaps this is also called "benefit of the doubt".

He spent like a month doing this for 6 hours per day during lockdown. After doing many hundreds or thousands of these, he started to see them during the day, even if he before he though he was not capable of seeing or hearing with his mind (aphantasia).
