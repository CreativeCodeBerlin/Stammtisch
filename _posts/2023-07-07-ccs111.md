## Presentations part 1



**Abe**

Producing tool for a painter/performer who performs on façades of buildings, performer is colorblind. Abe created a tablet based tool to sonify his paintings.

Using SuperCollider, first on iPad, then on a Windows Tablet.

To read the accelerometer first he tried Godot, but he couldn't figure out how to sign the application, so he built an app in C# instead.

The core app is writter in C++ with openFrameworks and it samples 12 points on camera. The hues control the pitch, the brightness controls volumes. And tablet tilt controls overall volume. He wanted to use OSC, but couldn't make it work with C# so switched to UDP messages. He changed tech stacks 4/5 times already.

Uses hysteresis to sample colors into buckets for synthesis.



**Bruce**

Visual artist/SW developer, plays bass in several bands ([http://batchass.fr)](http://batchass.fr))

He met Hexler(TouchOSC creator) in Live Performers Meeting who showed an early version of Kodelife realtime glsl code editor(livecoding shaders on the GPU).

It was the inspiration for Bruce to create his own shader mixing software, which does audio reactive visuals with Cinder, added tools for interacting with the shaders (OSC, FFT analysis, image mixing, MIDI, websockets, Spout)

Open source (currently Bruce is the only user because it's C++ :-p )

**Nikita**

Slit-scan experiments, photos as a texture, analogue feeling

Used for panoramic photography, aesthetic purposes

Poetic interpretation of the experiments, cycles of life

Collaboration with performer friend

Using a tool called cables.gl

Pixelation effect in experiments with faster rates

Digital as simplification compared to analog world

Radial slit-scan experiments

Edge detection slit-scan experiments, combined with noise \& scaling



**Felix**

twitter: @FlexElektro

Javascript/Canvas2D experiments, Voxel landscapes, inspired by voxel tech from games like Comanche (early/mid 90s)

Combining voxel terrains with shadowing, precalculated shadows

Diamond-squares noise for generation

## Presentations part 2



**VJFader (James)** www.vjfader.com

- audiovisual using Unreal Niagara and Model 15 on iPad 

MoogZ synthesizer (Karplussy preset)

Node based programming in Unreal



**Jules**

Rendering programmer. Doing lots of shader programming on his spare time.

Take the techniques we do in shaders and make them more accessible to everyone, including ppl who don't code.

Coollab: [https://coollab-art.com/](https://coollab-art.com/)

Node-based interface to create shader-like art, using Dear ImGUI's node interface

**Enrique**

- [https://bit.ly/41dpNYj](https://bit.ly/41dpNYj)

Machine shaped as a baseball hat, for cops

Enrique likes baseball a lot, MLB and Japanese League

He gifted a cap to an old man in Mexico

Visited Izapa, where he heard the tale of people who wore hats to protect from invaders(?)

Project started from the visor, brass bolts and inserts, added potentiometers

Laser projectors on visor, mapping the space

Studied lots of approaches, including FPGAs, SWIR sensors, I2R

Enrique is patenting the tech

Modelling a little mind (with neural network tech) to read and inflict thoughts on the wearer
