## Presentations part 1



**Maren Strack**

[https://maren-strack.de/en/](https://maren-strack.de/en/)

Visual artist. Her next piece involves a costume with accordions.

Maren is asking a technical question regarding her new project where she plans to project two accordions into 2 huge fans attached to her arms. In a sense of interactive projection mapping.

Solutions proposed:

    - Use an infrared light illuminating only the fans and performer but not the background wall. Then use an infrared camera to extract the contour from the black and white image captured by the camera. Then process this b\&w image using custom software.

    - Kinect depth camera.

    - IR LEDs attached to the fans.

    - Use a phone to detect the fan orientation orientation, send the orientation value to a computer to produce visuals.

    - Back projection so no need for tracking or segmentation.

    - An crazy complex system of threads and wire pulleys that detects the exact position of the arms and the performer

    - Small IMU sensors on the extremities of the fans.

    - Rotary potentiometer controlled by someone, no sensors needed.



**Josh**

Josh presents the berghain box, an antique tin tabbaco box converted into a perpetual kick machine. The box includes an arduino running mozzi and produces an 8bit kick sound. Together with the physical knobs, Johsn can produce diverse 4n4 kick tracks.

**Micha**

Synesthesia audio-reactive visual instrument for VJs and AV performers

[https://app.synesthesia.live/docs/](https://app.synesthesia.live/docs/)

Uses they custom shader language, SSF (Synesthesia Shader Format) which is a variation of ISF (Interactive Shader Format). Easy to import shaders from shadertoy and other shader sandboxes.

Shows a live visuals demonstration with music and a MIDI controller to perform with parameters over a patch created using Synesthesia framework and custom shaders.

Note: Synesthesia is proprietary software with a license but it is "relatively cheap"

**David**

[https://netart.today/](https://netart.today/)

Curator of this prestigious gallery that exclusively collects broken net art that doesn't work anymore.

There are organisations that are attempting to preserve it but it's pretty hard and it doesn't pay much.

David shows this work of net-art as an example: [https://anthology.rhizome.org/airworld](https://anthology.rhizome.org/airworld)



Would like to receive suggestions on how to experience broken digital artworks in a better way than simple screenshots.

Animator, mixing 2D and 3D with Blender. Lately experimenting with AI.

Presents some of her amazing video loops.

Shows example of video with face tracking and generative "face mask".



**Irune Arancibia**

[https://vimeo.com/839376170](https://vimeo.com/839376170)

Edited with Touch Designer to add visual effects. She would like to learn more about TD and what you can do with it.



**Anna and Tiago**

[https://github.com/akinml/buchla](https://github.com/akinml/buchla)

Audio synthesis in Python in a Jupyter notebook

Recreating a Buchla synthesizer.

They demo a long study in sound generators of different kinds. The notebook can visualize the waveforms and play them aloud.
