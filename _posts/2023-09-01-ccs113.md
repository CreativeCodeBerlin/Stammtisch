== introductions ==



**Sam**

Was a student at the School of Machines, Making and Make Believe where he developed an interactive installation: a fortune teller machine that accepts coins. More money gives you a better future. The machine uses chatGPT to generate texts, then the texts are read aloud. It makes this comment: with more money you have a better future.



The module to accept coins costs 20 eur online, and it's programmable to accept different types of coins.



Shows the kind of message he fed into chatGPT to obtain fortune teller-like texts.



THe voice is generated with a free python package that uses google audio translator voices.



Reference: another machine at an Ethereum crypto-coin conference there was a machine in which you pull a lever to generate a random hash. There's a chance that this hash is someone's wallet, so you could potentially make money.





**Alma**

Shares a project idea: she was in Latvia, Riga by herself. 

And explained about jellyish battles she did as a kid.

Looking at the patterns on the sand it reminded her of some kind of visualization of the waves. She took photos of the patterns and is thinking on how to convert them into sound.



Last month she co-organized the Creative Code Hideout event where she gave a workshop on TouchDesigner inspired on typeface motion designs fro AfterEffects.

**Nikita**

Shows an spaghetti monster (his cables.gl patch which he uses for live visuals). When performing he uses MIDI controllers to manipulate the visuals.



A new feature is coming to cables.gl: to separate the editing and rendering windows into different tabs, which is very convenient for live performances.



In one of his sketches, there are two 3D models spinning partially rendered and an collection of words chosen randomly. These words are shown sequentially, creating a story.



Asks about using generative art to talk about "Communication". Looking for references, past works, ideas on that topic for his next show.

**Gabor**

Shows the video "continous microtonal glissandro for 8 oscillators, done in Pure data".

as inspiration for a live shader-coding project where, visually, he lowly detune two oscilator. Resulting on a series red plotted curves that creates interesting wobbly shapes.

Smile to See

Studied in the Goldsmith university in London. He was inspired by the problems caused by an automated photograhing machine used in the passport-visa center, which failed to notice that his eyes were open due to his Asian background.
