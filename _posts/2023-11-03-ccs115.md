**Victor**

Shows a project on geometry nodes in Blender to procedurally generate a scene. Created it for the Nodevember challenge "gorgeous garden": a scene with stones, rocks, bamboo, in a box. Also shows other procedural blender Nodes projects, e.g. a "smart watch" with a garden emerging from the screen.

Victor hopes this time he can follow the whole Nodevember month



**Kazik**

Remix of an old work, based on some new principles. Inspired by Synesthesia (one sense perceived through another sense). Kazik has many friends who have Synesthesia. Ambition is to be able to visualize how they experience sound. Some music has more potential to give this effect than others. Found a composer (Oliver Buckland) whose work is extraordinary in this respect (shows demo on shadertoy with music). Just intonation, intervals mathematically perfect and the ratio they create is perfect and he is using many auditory illusions (like Shepard's tones).

Shows how he transforms FFT's output for more appealing visual results.

**James**

Shows a video he did as freelance work for a club in Ulan Bataar. Looks like an alien spaceship landing on the venue's ceiling: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CxnSW\_4N1I1/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxnSW\_4N1I1/)

Technique is anamorphic 3D content ("forced perspective"): Gives you illusion of 3D when looking at image from a particular angle. With this installation, distorted content is shown pixel-mapped onto LED displays on ceiling and back wall. Was inspired by similar projection in an Ibiza club.



== announcements ==



- James: AVjam is happening at MotionLab, last Friday of each month. Next is November 24.

- Lena: Looking for a flat

- Kazik: looking for artists to share a studio space in their location (Prachtsaal.berlin)

**Antoine** 

Animated emojis from OpenMoji. Looked for pairs of shapes that look good when animated together / morphing into each other. [https://openmorphi.vercel.app](https://openmorphi.vercel.app)

Also working on an eslint plugin eslint-ninja to make code look horrible, e.g. right-indent lines, prefix variables with their declaration, replace variable names with emojis etc. Preview available here: [https://www.dont.ninja](https://www.dont.ninja)



**Nu√±o**

Shows videos+photos about project he did earlier this year during two-month residency in Chengdu, titled (re)Made in China. Recycled local plastic trying to recreate ancient styles of art. Had to overcome many difficulties to find providers and work locally. Worked with molds and injection plastic. How to work with local production and be experimental without falling into the trap of "just produce in China because it's cheap."

**Joe**

Demoes program he is developing for probabilistic composition based on Jazz theory. Built his own modules for VCV Rack ([https://vcvrack.com/)](https://vcvrack.com/)), a free program for simulating modular synthesis. Oscillators, clock, random sampler, quantizer. Hard to change chords and create melodic sequences accross all parts of the system in this system, which is why he created his module called BASIE. Chord progressions are saved as JSON in source code. Module can turn random input into melodies. Long-term goal: enable live jazz musicians to play over this tool with full jazz canon in it; turn it into hardware (how to run C on hardware?). The "Jazz" parameter (knob) controls how much the melody fits the chord progression.

**Josh**

Shows recent work. Used tool called Videogrep that extracts all text and assigns timestamps. In second phase tool samples videos where a given text is said, and merges them into a new one.

Also used a Youtube video downloader to grab full playlists. Collected many apology videos.

At this time the war in Israel started. Superimposed instances of "me" from apology videos on top of black-and-white war footage.
