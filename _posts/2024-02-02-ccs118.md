**Guitong**

Guitong presents their online portfolio on medium: [https://medium.com/@Guitong](https://medium.com/@Guitong)



By using pandas and SuperCollider, they generate audio based on data. For instance, the temperature records from different month in a years.

Also, based on data from a Bangladesh hospital, they create a series of audio following a rule based on the answers of the patients (in this case, moms) separating the answers by a kickdrum and using the symptoms to identify audio segments.

Another project utilizes data from missing migrants. Every second means a person missing or dead. Encoding on the audio the latitude and longitude of the location of the event sing pitch and volume. On a 4-month long dataset, it generates a 40mins length audio piece.

**VJ Fader/James**

James shows a WIP DIY project combining music and ferrofluid. 

Found a device (Music2 RF Controller) which has a microphone built in and can control RGB lights.

But it's kinda useless so they're gonna return it.

So James created his very own ferrofluid audio visualizer using a series of hardware, like an audio amplifier, AD/DC converter, and electromagnet, enclosing the ferrofluid on a flask and placing it in front of the magnet.

Matthias created a digital audio synth module and using VCV Rack ([https://vcvrack.com/)](https://vcvrack.com/)) and shows us a demo of an additive synthesis (the inverse of Fourier analysis) module he made.

The idea he based the module on, is the Eratosthenes, an algorithm to find prime numbers. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve\_of\_Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve\_of\_Eratosthenes)

The synth can create a very low fundamental note and combine it with complementary tones, based those prime numbers, to create harmonic tones.

Matthias showed us a video of the synth working on a full patch and exploring it's possibilities.

**Philipp**

[https://philippartus.com/](https://philippartus.com/)

Philipp is working on a short animation film. Shows off one of the main characters.

Light exhibitions. 

Project in October. Octogonal structure with several projections. 

Considered showing it at Burning Man but the logistics of doing it in the desert discouraged him to apply. Instead showed it in Scottsdale Arizona.

Request for an exhibition in China. Shows a fish-like creature. They thought it was too abstract and artistic. They wanted it more cute. New one is less symmetrical and looking more like a beluga whale. Big projection wall.

Then Philipp did a similar exhibition in Hong Kong connected with the previous one.

For the next exhibition, Philipp is creating a fluid particle simulation that can visualize the flow of fluids inside of water and air mediums and the state in between.

Also simulating tornadoes, wind, and the collision of those effects.

Working with Processing and shaders via a library (PixelFlow). [https://diwi.github.io/PixelFlow/](https://diwi.github.io/PixelFlow/)

Diana presents a cyborg armor project for a performance

The armor combines different hardware around the body's physiognomy to control audio effects such as metal breasts for feedback and speakers on the hips.

During an artist residency in Tokyo, Diana brought the cyborg armor to the teamLab for a performance.



**Sean**

Sean grew up in the north San Francisco area. Around 2021, Sean was figuring out what to do.

As a project to create empathy in the community, Sean created a project that collects and places on the map stories from BIPOC neighbors.

Sean reached out asking for collecting anonymous stories on audio files.
