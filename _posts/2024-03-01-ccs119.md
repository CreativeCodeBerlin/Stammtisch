Recently creating audio and visuals in a single tool, Unreal Engine and utilizing [metasounds](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/metasounds-the-next-generation-sound-sources-in-unreal-engine/).

**Josh**

Makes art as Lucidbeaming. Recently into printmaking, lino cuts. Looked for ways to combine it with 3D scans and found anaglyphs. Anaglyphs: splitting an image into left+right to create a 3D illusion for the viewer. Scanned a reptile in Naturkundenmuseum with iPhone Lidar, reduced model to basic mesh. Used [plotter.vision](https://trmm.net/Plotter-Vision/) to remove hidden lines, plotted result as red+blue anaglyph image. Shares series of images with attendees, hands out 1 pair of glasses to view :)

Shows update on ferrofluid ("magnetic ink") project he has been developing since last month. Arduino does simple peak detection to make ink dance in bottle. 3D-printed a case for the magnet & bottle; will add LED strip for illumination. New update next month :)

Used to create precisely timed, looped experiences as a magician for people, using MP3 players. Went on to develop immersive games, e.g., a dance game. Worked on a collaboration with a web developer to produce software and interface to control the sync audio files for the guided experiences.
