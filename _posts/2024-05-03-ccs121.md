SVG is a file format that contains vector shapes and text. He created <https://svg-tutorial.com>  which explains how to create designs with SVG directly by writing XML syntax. Including some interaction via JavaScript.

Also, Hunor shows a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNqgatGqvC8&ab_channel=HunorM%C3%A1rtonBorb%C3%A9ly) on how to do CSS 3D transformations and other examples with three.js.

He created a ferro-fluid display that reacts to sound. It has a microphone input at the back.

We see work in progress photos and videos. Initially the case was box-shaped. The second case was like a rounded box, 3D printed at Motion Lab. Since the light was going through the plastic, he painted the inside. One of the next versions uses organic supports, so it looks like baobab trees on the inside.

Later he switched to Arduino Nano as a controller.Next he switched to Arduino Nano as a controller to save space.

Later he had a meltdown, the shape half burned, the glass broke. A "tragic event".

Once again he created a new shape, more rounded, low poly. 14 hours print. The back has ventilation intakes and a fan with a heat sink.

Uses a thermal protector:

There is a knob and a secret button to change the brightness and hue of the back light.

Teaser: Maps, learning French, and cat pictures.

He recently discovered user scripts: something that allows to inject your own scripts into any random website you view on your computer. He demos how to write one to make all links on a website colored pink and twice as large as usual.

The area where he has been applying those user scripts is in Duolingo, to make it work better for his learning goals. He blurs texts so listening is required. He also integrated pronunciation in the phonetic alphabet from Wiktionary into Duolingo. And also added images in pop-up bubbles. The enrichments are retrieved live by the script from Wiktionary.

Finally a quick demo of showing all the gluten free restaurants in open street map.

Site where people share user scripts: <https://greasyfork.org/en>. Useful addons: greasemonkey; tampermonkey, violentmonkey

**Tina**

Shows a hardware SSH key and other 3D-printed hardware for a guitar strap instead of working on her Visa application.

Tina has worked on an audio hardware amplifier for a Nintendo 3DS with a case cadded on Fusion360

In order to supply power to a headphone microphoe, Tina also build a circuit and printed a case.

Finally shows a spherical trasparent dome she's working on to avoid inhaling smoke in Berlin clubs.

**Josh -**  Lucidbeaming

He waited for 4 years to hear about a patent he applied for, which was rejected. So he's releasing vid2midi. It's a command line python script which converts video into midi data. He demoes converting an mp4 to a mid file, then play it in garage band.
