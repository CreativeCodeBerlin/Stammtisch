People like ice-cream.



**Jim**



Inspired by his book (James Gleick - The Information), Jim created a program called "Techno Drum Language App" using Elm and JavaScript. In the book they describe (among many other things) how tribes could communicate long distance with drums. The program takes texts and turns phonemes into sounds.

**Adrian**



Adrian is a filmmaker with engineer background. Frustrated with the industry boring ideas and excited by AI visualization technology.

Last october he dug up an old script of his to make the movie with the available tools these days. A full movie would be to complex, so he went in for 9 actors/actresses around a table without much preparation, showing actual emotions. It's a psychological thriller. In Februrary he put together a teaser.

"ü§´ What if we kissed at the intersection of art and technology? üôà"

[https://twitter.com/FeltZine/status/1378336860146126855](https://twitter.com/FeltZine/status/1378336860146126855)

Artist working at the intersection of code and craft. She's doing embroidery using technology. An embroidery machine. A very loud machine, so it sits on some pads to absorb the noise.

Reading "The Other Side".

She studied old embroidery in a book called Computer Kunst where they used the Basic programming language to created designs.

Currently she uses p5.js to generate patterns, then uses Processing to produce the right patterns for her machine.

The machine connects all shapes with the thread, so separate shapes are connected by lines. She decided to consider this a feature instead of a bug.

**Yufeng**



Creative technologist visiting from NY. 

His friend Yutong Lin needed help with a project: to film her aunt who lives in Canada cooking a dish, and narrating about cooking that dish and moving to Canada.

Inspired by "Shadowtime" by Sister Sylvester and Deniz Tortum.

Depthkit too expensive for their project.

Bought 4 RealSense cameras to film the scene. (4 x $60). These cameras give RGB + Depth. He used TouchDesigner (instead of soldering sync cables and writing their own software). The produced video files are huge.

Using [https://github.com/manurare/360monodepth](https://github.com/manurare/360monodepth) to generate depth 360 enviroments from static photos

Lesson learned: Do not use Unity (it doesn't like lossless video)



**G√°bor**



Gabor has lately been interested in pen plotting art with vector images made with code.

He is showing a series of plotter prints done with different algorithms exploring lines and curves with techniques like flowfields, k-d threes, randomly eliminating lines...

Spending time in this world of creating has been his escape from other parts in life with more anxiety.



Another series of images were inspired by [https://ismahelio.com/](https://ismahelio.com/)

Made a synthesizer out of a cigar box (Partag√°s Brand - Habanos, S.A.) from the French embassy.

Combining laser-cutting, lots of cables and voltage distributions, and at least two teensy boards. It is an imperfect machine beloved by Josh and done under public domain.

Hint for performance opportunities: Noiseberg
