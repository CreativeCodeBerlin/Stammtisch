Little Martians/ Tales from a Simulation - laser cuttings, collaboration with generative artists, projections, publishing, generative storytelling. Mars college! An offroad community in the middle of the desert. A sci-fi world, yo! Lots of unicycles. She used clay, ceramics, made awesome little martian heads. Verdelis sculpture.

Creative Technologist, Generative Artist, Teacher

Shows a new way to do programming without coding, using HTML+Javascript. Uses AI assistant Claude in his teaching: [https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai)

They're attempting to make an interactive cat face in p5.js without any explanations. Claude's "artifact" feature runs the code in a panel, but in this case it is not working, so Raphael is copy-pastig code into the real p5.js editor. He successfully prompts Claude to create a cat that blinks and follows the cursor with its eyes.

Generative artist and writer. Microcosm project, making abstract images with code. Showing how to deform a circle with perlin noise or a sine wave. Technique of deforming polygons, domain warping. Shows how he adapted circle packing to be "polygon packing," for irregular shapes that still don't overlap.

Cat sledding - exploring games as a medium for recording memories

Friends moved to the French countryside and had a baby. Wanted to send them a special gift. They adopted four kittens from their garden. This gave him the idea for a game - cat sledding, to send as a little surprise to them. The cats are pulling a sled in the south of France, racing to the hospital through the snow, so the mother can give birth to her baby.

**Sophie \& Dirk**

They met at the jam 3 weeks ago, and decided to do a project together in the span of a week. Sophie produced one track a day, a sort of sound diary, and Dirk represented them visually. Each track is 90 minutes, and plays with a sketch made in p5.js.



"Born here and shown here"

**Neel**



[https://kinogram.neel.sh](https://kinogram.neel.sh) (check link?)- a project that generates random kinograms. A kinogram consists of an image, and a file of stripes, each on a piece of paper. If you move the stripes in front of the image, the image appears to be animated. The browser app lets you explore parameters for creating a new kinogram generatively. How it works: uses "jump flooding" algorithm to create a distance field, and ray marching.

***Record-o-mat* **An old green telephone booth has been transformed into a public recording studio. Even as an object, it is visible from afar, an auratic sculpture, a nostalgic reminder of a pre-digital era.

nostalgic reminiscence of a pre-digital era. It casually invites all those who happen to pass by and stroll by to

strollers to interrupt the flow of movement for a moment and pause. A multifaceted sound sculpture sounds from the loudspeakers in the immediate vicinity of the telephone booth at a chatting volume. Here you can ‚Äúdock‚Äù for a moment, let the anticipated path be a path and enter into a new relationship of meaning with the place, the moment and the soundscape.

***Fragment*** is a generative music duo that seamlessly blends organic and synthetic sounds to create sonic landscapes that evolve in real-time. Their performances are a journey through a constantly shifting audio terrain that invites listeners to lose themselves in a sonic storytelling.

Would be happy to join an event in Berlin and perform!





**Micha**

Discovered a TouchDesigner plugin from volumetric textures ([https://www.instagram.com/p/C7xJMnftNro/)](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7xJMnftNro/)). Decided to create an audioreactive piece. Used Synesthesia for the audio part.



His technique moves a torues in space based on a 3D texture. Uses 3D feedback to modulate it in real time. The volume is a density field, and it is rendered with ray marching.



"It's just a feedback network"



So far it has been a research project, but he now has ideas to use it in a dance performance.

Lena (IG @lucidbln) was inspired by Dan Gorelick to live code music (in Tidal Cycles) when he came to a CCB Stammtisch in spring of 2023. Then in November, she had a live coding performance with algorave Berlin at Ohm Club, and later decided it might be kind of neat to incorporate elements of that set into her and Tom's audiovisual project "Wake". Tom creates live visuals driven by Lena's OSC signals, using his Tooll environment.



Their setup overlays Lena's source code for the music with Tom's visuals.
