Icebreaker Question: What's your favourite IKEA furtinute?

**Tibor Udvari**

The first OpenGL example is usually "how to draw a triangle". This first complex C++  example demotivated him for a while, until he discovered Processing. He went to the Resonate festival and found it very inspiring, with people developing their own tools. He did his thesis project about Processing and its community.

Thesis: https://sonar.ch/documents/328908/preview/UDVARI%20Tibor.pdf

Last year he started working with headsets. He didn't find it very easy to get started with Unity and an Oculus headset. It involves some hours and lots of steps to just get it running. He thought there should be an easier way to do it. He created "Spatial p5".
He shows a demo video where we see that it is like a live coding Processing environment similar / based-on to Processing. It uses p5.js, p5.xr, and P5LIVE for live collaboration.

Tibor figured out how to simplify and make less technical the usage of p5xr.

**Josh**

Josh is working on an AI/sound project called "Oracle" where charms from a lost Halloween collar are used to create audio by placing them on a black matt.

There is a camera pointing down at a table to detects two kinds of objects: teeth and skulls. The software sees their position and converts it to data sent to a small synthesizer.

The setup is composed by a camera connected to an AI chip with a model loaded in the chip, it converts the data to MQTT and sends it to a raspby with a synth.

The project works like an oracle, where the small halloween charsm are throwwn into the table resembling the rituals of fotrune tellers.

He throws over 10 objects under the camera which produces an audio sequence.
The interpretation of the images is linear and not random, so the sounds can be reproduced. The placement of the objects in front og the camera is is random.

And here a transciption of the events:
    <<Puru puru puru bip bip bip, pim pum pum. titutitutitu, bhsbhsbhsbhs, and CRASH!>>

**Deniz**

Deniz have been searching for a new creative direction. She heard "pay attention to what you are paying attention to" and found that inspiring.

She found an interactive visualization about covid transmission rates on a room.

https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2020-11/coronavirus-aerosols-infection-risk-hotspot-interiors
She found that viz amazing, compared to other text-based ones.

She wanted to create something similar but on "differential growth". How to make that understandable? She spent a lot of time making an interactive visualization. Then noticed that it's missing "engagement". It contained a not-so-fun detailed explanation.

Also inspired by the articles on https://pudding.cool/ which provides information bit by bit, with beautiful visuals.

She wanted to try again, in this case about the Physarum algorithm. She published this (https://denizbicer.com/202408-UnderstandingPhysarum.html) today.
Long time ago she found the mxsage explanation and it took her a long time to understand. She wanted to make it easier for others to understand, so she made an interactive visualization / explanation to show how it works, with various parameters you can see and modify to observe how the simulation changes.

**Philipp Artus**

Presents a project for the Light festival in Brussels
https://www.brussels.be/bright-brussels
4 x (30000lumen, 4K). 
He tried adding a star-shaped creature, because of the EU-topic (stars in the flag).
For various reasons, he didn't manage to create in time for the Brussels event, but still made it work afterwards.

During the summer he presented for the first time his octogon-based installation.

He was a bit frustrated that he didn't manage to have a new version ready for the Fusion festival, but then he finally presented it in his studio in a smaller event.

The reason to miss his own deadlines was probably that he didn't want to rush, but produce something of good quality and maintainable, together with the fact that he did have something he could present in any case (the previous version).

**Erkal**

https://erkal.github.io
Strongly believes that the best way to teach programming is to write code and see beautiful stuff changing on the other side
He uses a purely functional programming language called Elm.

He's been wondering how to let people play with creative coding without writing all the code (initially) but let them manipulate numbers and observe the results.

Toguetehr with a friend, they would like to bring this fun simple educative tools to spätis and other spaces in neighborhoods.
They are also looking for collaborators with more tech backgroun and hardware knoledge who can help them implementing and produce the project.

**Matti**

He used to paint walls on clubs while drinking club mate. He realized that changing paintings was very hard, so he discovered creative coding. But code looked scary. Next he realized that one can code using nodes (like touch designer). He also realized that it's still not easy, and he needs to practice and create every day. The TD people wrote a post about him, which motivated him even more, and created hundreds of sketches.
He still wanted to learn to code, and joined Creative Code Berlin.
He was producing programs for hundreds of days. Then discovered GLSL, and spent a lot of time learning about shaders.

He wants to share how to learn about shaders, and shows links to resources. He's been writing shaders now for 80 days. Now he is combining touch designer with the shaders he can now write. And reached the point to publish his very first full shadertoy shader.

And created the poster image for last month, CCB background sketch.

Set simple goals and do something every day. Now he is writing every day 750 words.

She joined long time ago and met Taru, who gave her the Nature of Code book.

She was fascinated by "time displacement" techniques. She wanted to integrate dance with new media, display it in a different way. She's happy that she could interact and work with the break-dancing community.

In one project she did 3D capture a dancer, brought it into Blender and grew organic looking plant-like shapes on the model.
