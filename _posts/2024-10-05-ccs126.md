**Kazik**

Kazik is showing an audio-reactive project done at prachtsaal studios.
https://prachtsaal.berlin/
But actually, he intended to show an AI based tool using Claude and its API.
A new tool was released by Anthropic / Claude and he wanted to be able to use it in Kotlin (his favorite programming language), but they only released other languages.
So he wrote it himself and called it Claudine. He can type questions in the console of his IDE (JetBrains) and t
> Which operating system is this?
(it responds correctly)
> Create a P5.js project in /tmp/p5.html with a cat's face.
(it does, he opens it in the browser and the face is there)
He created a executable multiplatform tool which is roughly 5Mb, so anyone could use it on their computers. The tool can answer questions and create other tools as a response to user queries.

**Matthias**

A big VCVRack patch. He's building modules and demos them starting with a blank project. He turns knobs and the sound changes :-)
His own modules are names: Ad, Adje, Bufke, Funs, Huub, Dannie, Sjaak
The allow very complex chains of multichannel signals, potentially delayed on a buffer.
He wrote most of it on C++, and the visual part are made of SVG vector files.

Nadia is into fragment shaders during her free time: small programs that run in the GPU. They use the XY coordinate of a pixel to calculate its color. People create all kinds of crazy effects with them. In other words: they are pictures and animations defined by code.

Nadia also does code golfing, which is trying to make the programs as small as possible, removing character by character to make them tiny.

We see an interesting rotating black and white fractal generated with just 106 characters of code. The platform where the code is hosted is https://twigl.app/
which is similar to Shadertoy, another platform

- Kazik
  - Wants to run workshops at Prachtsaal to teach all the tooling he's built to run chatbots for running AI locally.
  - Also looking for comissions. Good at backend integrations, shader dev, any type of software.
- Shaka: Looking for a place to stay in November / December.
- Deadline demo party 2024: https://www.demoparty.berlin/
- Nuño looking for professional color grader (in Davinci)

**Simon**

Interaction designer who runs some code on a watch that transmit motion data in real time to a computer. It can detect pinching gestures with thumb + index finger.
Demos playing an OP1 and the shakes in the watch control a filter.
MIDI wrist unleashed app.
https://docs.doublepoint.com/docs/wowmouse/
The initial idea that sparked doublepoint was a text prediction project where, by utilizing a wristband, one can type on mid-air keybard free.

**Bertha & Alberto**

Bertha is a musician and composer. With Alberto they've been working on
RAVE: Real time Audio Variational autoEncoder
https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE
They have been multiple times at the Jam trying to push forward their sound/AI project.
They used the workbook of Moises Horta aka Hexorcismos where one can have a colletion of audio datasets to train the AI machine. They upload 2 hours of their music to the system. In that workbook website you add a link to your google drive where the music is hosted, then the training happens, which produces a model.
They present this UV projects:

"Túneles.AI 9:59 -  Bertha Elena Artero Ponce"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZedZH69uR7s&ab_channel=comusik

They used traditional Bolivian musical instruments and some simple oscilators made with the help of  https://agentecostura.art/ Lisa Simpson, plus a video of waterfalls from Hampaturi - La Paz made by Lluvia Bustos Soria and edited by Bertha.
