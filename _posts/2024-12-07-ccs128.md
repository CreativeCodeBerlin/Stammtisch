**Alex**

Research project, generative art. About an immortal worm that lives forever (called Planaria). If you split it, each part continues to live. Each part knows what part is missing and it grows it back. A scientist convince(d?) a worm to grow two heads. Eww. The parts use bioelectrical patterns to decide what to grow. Alex shows a cellular automata simulating that work. Similar to game-of-life. In that simulation one can erase part of the creature and it grows back.

The algorithm is interesting. All the parts have the same information, they observe their surrounding to know how to evolve. Mentions Turing, who was interested in how zebras get their stripes.
Alex built such a simulation in ShaderToy. It is an automata algorithm that creates a pattern reminiscent of Bauhaus art.
Due to limitations in ShaderToy, Alex went to develop a webGPU version.

Alex build a portable installation work wth a powerbank + beamer to display the shader.

**Carlo**

He went from very high level programming to very low level, painful. 
The final group project at 42 School was made in JavaScript, Python and C. An online pong game. Also a terminal client using a self made library in C
to render graphics on terminal, using only 1 write system call per frame.

Looking for job/internships

**Servando**

http://servando.teks.no/
Passionate about audio & tech. Made audiovisual synthesizers. On using Lissajous curves. Specialized in PureData and interactive installations and performances. VJ for 7 or 8 years. Studied electronics. RBMA-20 the largest sequencer in the world (10 meters and 3 lanes).
http://servando.teks.no/?serquencer
Servando also made the MultiJonas software, and audio based MIDI-&-OSC controller.
The software is built for a band of musicians, analizing the sound of each performer, converts the audio pitch and amplitude via MIDI and OSC.
Presents many of the projects found on their website. One of them prints all the Unicode characters on a web page:

The code is very minimal and fits in a tweet.

Tintenpflanze. An e-paper based growing tree. It detects the light of day and night, and then during the day it grows a tree. He saw in mastodon someone posting about an e-paper display. Used an L-System (The algorithmic beauty of plants) and grammars.
It seems like his device is a bit finicky with power: powered via USB sometimes just shows noise. It works best when powered via batteries.
A small component detects light intensity and decides if it's day or night.
That ESP32 tiny computer runs an 120 Mhz, when his first Commodore 64 ran at 1 Mhz.

**Tony**

Archeology. Finding old things and archiving them. Art restoration and preservation.
And video games. Tony tries preserving old video games from a Nintendo 3DS by emulating them on a modern computer. Shows Super Mario and Legend of Zelda.
Nintendo 3DS emulation history goes back 10 years now. Tony will give a talk about this history at Chaos Communication Congress.
Another thing worth preserving is the social network they had online, with all the messages and drawings that people drew with the stylus. And even video clips featuring music and animation. Old developers are now involved in bringing back functionality even if Nintendo did shut down the servers.

CCC talk is called "10 years of emulating the Nintendo 3DS".
Talk will be on Dec 28th and livestream at ccc https://www.ccc.de/en/

**Gilbert**

Has been building designs for TV using the video titles generators, in ASCII, using a limited character set. Gilbert presents a web application for drawing animated ASCII artworks, used for submission to Arecibo Message 50 year anniversary. Characters and colors can be controlled with oscilators and MIDI assignements. A video was produced with music by Boxcutter and shown at Bochum and Hamburg planetariums. He shows an initial test print of the artwork on canvas paper.

**Victor**

Victor left his job. üëè
And has been working on a personal project (llm party). A series of small works, with a small deadline, using AI.
Has been using a coding tool called aider: https://aider.chat/
Since having kids, Victor hasn't had any time for personal project, and Aider has drastically changed how much he can achieve in his limited time.
He shows a small p5js editor with an AI assistant that helps him write and modify code while summarizing the actions and highlighting the affected lines.
He realizes that with this kind of assistance, he changed the way he code. A middle way between coding and managing a team of developers.
Victor is using Claude by Anthropic. There is a local model that can do this that was released one month ago called qwen2.5-coder. You can download and run it using Ollama: https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder
