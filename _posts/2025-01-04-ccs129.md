Uses https://ratatui.rs/ for rendering the layout on the terminal buffer.

Genuary 2025
https://genuary.art/
Daily promp as inspiration to create something each day.
aBe is participating ths year.
For today, he created a program that looks at it´s own code and prints an image based on its own code-lines. For ever shame on aBe for using semicolons (;)
Another daily sketch aBe created simulates layers of sediments.
And the first entry was a colorfull image utilizing only horizontal lines.
